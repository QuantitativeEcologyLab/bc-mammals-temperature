## Analyses of Deviance

\noindent Here we produce approximate p-values for analyses of deviance (a form of generalized likelihood ratio tests) following the methods of Section 3.3 in @wood_generalized_2017. We use an $F$ test rather than a $\chi^2$ test for the Gamma models because the scale parameter for the Gamma distribution is estimated rather than known or fixed [as in the case of binomial or Poisson distributions -- see table 3.1 on page 104 of @wood_generalized_2017].
