              Background
              Speed and distance traveled provide quantifiable links between behavior and energetics, and are among the metrics most routinely estimated from animal tracking data. Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements ({SLDs}) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, {SLD} estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty.
            
            
              Methods
              To overcome the limitations of {SLD} estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance ({CTSD}) estimation method. An inherent property of working in continuous-time is the ability to separate the underlying continuous-time movement process from the discrete-time sampling process, making these models less sensitive to the sampling schedule when estimating parameters. The first step of {CTSD} is to estimate the device’s error parameters to calibrate the measurement error. Once the errors have been calibrated, model selection techniques are employed to identify the best fit continuous-time movement model for the data. A simulation-based approach is then employed to sample from the distribution of trajectories conditional on the data, from which the mean speed estimate and its confidence intervals can be extracted.
            
            
              Results
              Using simulated data, we demonstrate how {CTSD} provides accurate, scale-insensitive estimates with reliable confidence intervals. When applied to empirical {GPS} data, we found that {SLD} estimates varied substantially with sampling frequency, whereas {CTSD} provided relatively consistent estimates, with often dramatic improvements over {SLD}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The methods described in this study allow for the computationally efficient, scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled, without biases due to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, or the amount of measurement error. In addition to being robust to the sampling schedule, the point estimates come equipped with confidence intervals, permitting formal statistical inference. All the methods developed in this study are now freely available in the  package or the  point-and-click web based graphical user interface.},

              For free-ranging animals living in seasonal environments, hypometabolism (lowered metabolic rate) and hypothermia (lowered body temperature) can be effective physiological strategies to conserve energy when forage resources are low. To what extent such strategies are adopted by large mammals living under extreme conditions, as those encountered in the high Arctic, is largely unknown, especially for species where the gestation period overlaps with the period of lowest resource availability (i.e. winter). Here we investigated for the first time the level to which high arctic muskoxen (
              Ovibos moschatus
              ) adopt hypothermia and tested the hypothesis that individual plasticity in the use of hypothermia depends on reproductive status. We measured core body temperature over most of the gestation period in both free-ranging muskox females in Greenland and captive female muskoxen in Alaska. We found divergent overwintering strategies according to reproductive status, where pregnant females maintained stable body temperatures during winter, while non-pregnant females exhibited a temporary decrease in their winter body temperature. These results show that muskox females use hypothermia during periods of resource scarcity, but also that the use of this strategy may be limited to non-reproducing females. Our findings suggest a trade-off between metabolically-driven energy conservation during winter and sustaining foetal growth, which may also apply to other large herbivores living in highly seasonal environments elsewhere.},

Many different kinds of animals employ hibernation, and there is a spectrum of hibernation phenotypes. Here, we focus on obligatory mammalian hibernators to identify the unique challenges they face and the adaptations that allow hibernators to overcome them. This includes the cellular and molecular strategies used to combat low environmental and body temperatures and lack of food and water. We discuss metabolic, neuronal, and hormonal cues that regulate hibernation and how they are thought to be coordinated by internal clocks. Last, we touch on questions that are left to be addressed in the field of hibernation research. Studies from the last century and more recent work reveal that hibernation is not simply a passive reduction in body temperature and vital parameters but rather an active process seasonally regulated at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.},

              Torpor is a well-known energy conservation strategy in many mammal and bird species. It is often employed when environmental conditions are unfavourable to maximize survival probabilities. However, torpor often carries with it the physiological costs of a low body temperature and of rewarming in addition to potential missed opportunities for foraging. Therefore, we hypothesised that decision making regarding when to use torpor should reflect the most important environmental conditions for species distributions, and thus how they may be impacted by ongoing climate change. We investigated how weather conditions affect nightly torpor patterns in the nocturnal insectivorous Australian eastern long-eared bat (
              Nyctophilus bifax
              ). By measuring the skin temperature of 37 free-ranging individuals, we confirmed that torpor was used more frequently during the winter and at subtropical compared to tropical locations. Using mixed-effect models we show that lower ambient temperatures were the main driver of individual torpor use, probably due to lower roost temperatures and prey availability. However, increased rain, wind and humidity, and decreasing barometric pressure, as well as brighter moonlight, also led to more time spent torpid per night. We suggest that bats evaluate multiple environmental cues to make decisions regarding torpor use versus active foraging based upon their expectations of the energetic benefits, prey availability and relative predation risk. Interactions between some of these effects and body mass (whilst controlling for forearm length) indicate that individual variation in body size and/or state-dependent effects of energy reserves also partly determined the use of nightly torpor in these bats.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study : speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable.
            This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores ; four species of primates ; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species):
            
            where has the units ml O2 s−1 kg−1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s−1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Ėmetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20·1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible :
            
            where Ėmetab/Mb has the units watts/kg.
            This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \& Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this general equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25 \% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.},

            A spatially explicit capture-recapture ({SCR}) model was applied to estimate simultaneously population parameters and individual activity (i.e. home range size) of O. vulgaris, based on experimental mark-recapture data in a human-altered Mediterranean coastal area. Seventy-two octopuses were captured, tagged with subcutaneous {PIT}-tags and released. Nineteen tagged individuals were recaptured (recapture rate: 26.4\%) in the same area over the study period, which spanned over 6 months. Population sizes and densities decreased over the study period, from 337 octopuses (8 ind. ha−1) in September-October to 105 octopuses (2.5 ind. ha−1) in February-March. The highest recruitment probability was estimated to occur at the beginning of the study but it clearly decreased over time, while mortality probability during a fishing period slightly increased. Mean specific growth rate was 0.82 ± 0.11 day−1. Individual home range or activity area ranged from 2.8 ha to 7.3 ha (median home range radius: 121.8 m). Overall, these results suggest that human-altered coastal habitats, which are characterized by abundant shelters, abundant food and absence of predators, can act as settlement and growth areas for juveniles and adults of O. vulgaris. Furthermore, the methodologies applied in this study are recommended as innovative tools to improve management actions of coastal resources.},
