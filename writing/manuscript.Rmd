These changes in species' movement behavior have had cascading effects on individuals' fitness and habitat selection with consequences at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. Previous research has quantified changes in mammalian movement behavior, but we are lacking an estimate of the effects of climate change on fine-scale movement and habitat selection. We address this by using Continuous-Time Movement Models and Hierarchical Generalized Additive Models to quantify the effects of temperature on mammal's probability of movement, speed, and habitat selection. We then leverage the estimated effects to predict when, how, and where mammals will move in BC in the current century.

# Introduction

<!-- introduce knowledge gap -->

\noindent It is well understood that mammalian energetics depend on ambient temperature [@brown_toward_2004; @taylor_energetics_1982], but we have a limited understanding of how mammals adapt their movement behavior in response to temperature [@elmore_implications_2017; but see: @milling_seasonal_2017; @montgomery_movement_2019]. Previous work has focused on energetic costs of movement [@taylor_energetics_1982; @dyer_travel_2023], range shifts [@leclerc_determinants_2021], thermoregulation [@mota-rojas_physiological_2021; @melin_effect_2023], and trait-based responses [@mccain_assessing_2019], but there remains a need for a more comprehensive understanding of how mammals will adapt their fine-scale movement and habitat selection to future changes in temperature [@intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2023]. Movement plasticity [@nathan_movement_2008] allows mammals to react to changes in temperature on a shorter timescale than evolutionary physiological adaptations [@levins_evolution_1974]. By changing when, how, and where they move, mammals can conserve chemical and thermal energy as well as reduce the risk of overheating [@alston_temperature_2020; @dyer_travel_2023; @attias_effects_2018; @giroux_activity_2023; @verzuh_behavioural_2023; @williams_range_2018]. We present a multi-species analysis of how mammals adapt their movement behavior in response to changes in air temperature.

<!-- movement plasticity allows for rapid responses, but how does climate change impact this? -->

Recent changes in climate have affected mammals' movement rates and habitat selection [@deb_modelling_2020], but it is still unclear how changes in the current century will affect their fine-scale movement behavior and spatial distribution by the end of the century. In the last 200 years, many ecosystems experienced widespread warming that resulted in milder and shorter winters, hotter and longer summers, and a greater risk of extremely high temperatures and severe forest fires [@intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2023; @zurowski_summer_2023]. Over the next 100 years, these changes will continue to affect mammals' fitness, movement behavior, and habitat selection as they cope with growing heat stress [@deb_modelling_2020; @woo-durand_increasing_2020] and frequency and intensity of extreme events [@bunnell_global_2011] along with anthopogenic pressure [@sih_evolution_2011; @weststrate_how_2024].

<!-- implications for ecology: encounter rates, energetic expenditure, range shifts, consequences for conservation, etc -->

Understanding animals' responses to temperature is essential for anticipating their response to climate change in the coming decades and the cascade of consequences such changes will have. In light of the "30 by 30" conservation initiative, a global effort to conserve 30% of the world's lands and oceans by 2030 [@ref], we must understand which areas are best preserved to maximize the project's effectiveness. Predicting how climate change will affect how, when, and where animals will move is necessary for choosing which 30% of the world is most worth preserving. Changes in movement behavior impact several aspects of animals' fitness, behavior, and odds of survival, including encounter rates [with food, competitors, and predators: @martinez-garcia_how_2020], energetic expenditure [@taylor_energetics_1982], range shifts [@woo-durand_increasing_2020]. Thus, understanding the effects of temperature on animals' movement behavior and their consequences is crucial for effective conservation.

<!-- introduce the study -->

This paper provides an analysis of the effects of ambient temperature on the movement of six terrestrial mammal species in British Columbia (BC), Canada (*Canis lupus*, *Cervus canadensis*, *Oreamnos americanus*, *Puma concolor*, boreal and southern mountain *Rangifer tarandus*, and *Ursus arctos horribilis*; Table \@ref(tab:data-table)). Using over two decades of telemetry data over a large spatial range of British Columbia (Fig. \@ref(fig:bc-map)) and hourly air temperature data, we estimate how mammals altered their movement frequency, movement speed, and habitat selection in response to air temperature. We then pair the estimated responses with climate change projections to forecast changes in mammalian movement in 2100 under different climate-change scenarios [Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, see @riahi_shared_2017]. We discuss the consequences of these changes in movement behavior with regards to energetics, encounter rates, habitat conservation, and human-wildlife conflicts.

# Methods

## GPS telemetry data

\noindent Elk (*Cervus canadensis*) data from @ciuti_human_2012 were downloaded from Movebank [study name: Elk in southwestern Alberta, see @kays_movebank_2022], while boreal caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) and wolf (*Canis lupus*) telemetries were acquired via a public BC Oil and Gas Research and Innovation Society repository ([https://www.bcogris.ca/projects/boreal-caribou-telemetry-data](https://www.bcogris.ca/projects/boreal-caribou-telemetry-data)), and the mountain goat (*Oreamnos americanus*) locations were provided by BC Parks. All other tracking data were obtained from private collaborators. Outlier GPS locations were removed following diagnostic analyses of the distance from the median location as well as straight-line displacement, turning angle, and time interval between consecutive points. Particular attention was paid to points with large turning angles ($\gtrapprox 170^\circ$) and high straight-line displacement, especially if antecedent and subsequent points indicated stationary behavior. The script used to clean the data and all associated custom functions are available on GitHub ([https://github.com/QuantitativeEcologyLab/bc-mammals-temperature](https://github.com/QuantitativeEcologyLab/bc-mammals-temperature)).

## Historical temperature data

\noindent Rasters of hourly reanalyzed air temperature data were downloaded from the ERA5 dataset [@hersbach_era5_2023] from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting server (ECMWF; [www.ecmwf.int](www.ecmwf.int); [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu)). Proximal temperature was estimated for each location by extracting the values from the corresponding raster cell from the temporally nearest raster using the `extract()` function from the `terra` package [version 1.7-46, @hijmans_terra_2023] for `R`  [@r_core_team_r_2024].

## Estimating mammals' instantaneous speeds

\noindent We modeled each animal's movement using continuous-time movement models [@fleming_fine-scale_2014] via the `ctmm` package [version 1.2.0, @fleming_ctmm_2023] for `R`. We then estimated mammals' instantaneous speeds by applying the `ctmm::speeds()` function on all models with finite speed estimates [416 of 433, see @fleming_fine-scale_2014; @noonan_scale-insensitive_2019]. The 18 telemetries with insufficiently fine sampling were for one mountain goat, 15 boreal caribou, and 2 southern mountain caribou (Table \@ref(tab:data-table)).

Since `ctmm`'s movement models assume stochastic but non-zero speeds (i.e., a single, stochastic moving state), data-informed speeds needed to be corrected so that the minimum instantaneous speed could be 0. We performed this correction by subtracting each model's mean speed while assuming speeds were $\chi^2$-distributed.<!-- The degrees of freedom and Frequentist confidence intervals were adjusted accordingly.--> The function we used is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/QuantitativeEcologyLab/bc-mammals-temperature/blob/main/functions/detrend_speeds.R](https://github.com/QuantitativeEcologyLab/bc-mammals-temperature/blob/main/functions/detrend_speeds.R). To avoid artifacts due to excessively small, non-zero speeds, we determined whether an animal was moving or not using the inflection point of each species' histogram of detrended speed estimates (Appendix A).

## Estimating the effects of temperature on mammals' movement

The following two sections detail the modelling we used to estimate the effect on temperature on mammals' movement. To assess the importance of including temperature as an explicit covariate (rather than including its effects with time of day and day of year***HERE***), we fit models with and without temperature and compared the fits and model predictions of the two sets of models.

### Movement frequency and speed

\noindent We estimated the effects of temperature on mammals' movement state (moving or not) and speed (when moving) using two Hierarchical Generalized Additive Models [HGAMs, see @pedersen_hierarchical_2019 and the code chunk below] with the `mgcv` package for `R` [version 1.9-1, @wood_generalized_2017]. The first HGAM estimated the probability that an animal was moving with a binomial family of distributions and logit link function. The second HGAM estimated an animal's speed (when moving) with a gamma family of distributions and log link function. The HGAMs included random intercepts for each animal (`s(..., bs = 're')`), fixed intercepts for each species, and species-level factor smooth interactions for time of day, day of year, and temperature [`s(..., bs = 'fs')`, see model S in Figure 4 of @pedersen_hierarchical_2019]. Additionally, the models had three tensor product interaction terms (`ti()`) for each species: (1) day of year and time of day, (2) temperature and time of day, and (3) temperature and day of year. These three terms accounted for: (1) seasonal changes in day length, (2) hourly changes in the response to temperature (e.g., changes in nocturnality), and (3) seasonal changes in the response to temperature (e.g., changes in coats and migration timing). The HGAMs accounted for the cyclicity of time of day and day of year using cyclic cubic splines [`bs = 'cc'`, @wood_generalized_2017]. Together, the binomial HGAM and the gamma HGAM inform us on an animal's long-term average speed, since it is the product of the probability the animal is moving and its average speed when moving. We fit the models with fast REML (`'fREML'`) and discretized covariates (`discrete = TRUE`) to optimize computational efficiency with no appreciable losses to model performance [@wood_generalized_2015; @wood_generalized_2017-1; @li_faster_2020]. Additional details are provided in Appendix A.

### Habitat selection

\noindent We estimated the effects of temperature on each species' selection for percent forest cover, elevation, and distance from fresh water (i.e., not sea water) by fitting a Hierarchical Resource Selection Function [@aarts_estimating_2008; @refs; @10.1111/ecog.07225] an HGAM with a Poisson family of distributions and log link function for each species [Appendix B, also see @aarts_estimating_2008; @alston_mitigating_2022]. While we recognize there are other important drivers of habitat selection that we did not include in our models (e.g., forest age), we decided to only use these three proxies to produce results that are relatively comparable between species and to make province-wide predictions simpler. Each species' model had the same structure:

    s(elevation_m, k = 6, bs = 'tp') +
    s(dist_water_m, k = 6, bs = 'tp') +
    # animal-level deviations from the species-level average
    s(animal, bs = 're') +
    s(forest_perc, animal, k = 4, bs = 'fs', xt = list(bc = 'cr')) +
    s(elevation_m, animal, k = 4, bs = 'fs', xt = list(bc = 'cr')) +
    s(dist_water_m, animal, k = 4, bs = 'fs', xt = list(bc = 'cr')) +
    # changes in preference with temperature
    ti(forest_perc, temperature_C, k = 6, bs = 'cr') +
    ti(elevation_m, temperature_C, k = 6, bs = 'cr') +

Smooth effects of percent forest cover, elevation, and distance to fresh water accounted for the species-level average selection strength for each resource. A random effect for each individual animal corrected for uneven sampling across individuals, while factor smooth interaction terms (`bs = 'fs'`) accounted for individual-level resource selection (i.e., individual-level deviations from the species-level average). Finally, tensor interaction product terms (`ti()`) of the three resources and temperature estimated the change in resource selection at different temperatures. Detections were weighted proportionally to their degree of independence from temporally proximate detections [see Appendix C and @alston_mitigating_2022], while quadrature points had a weight of 1.

***does elk HRSF use different `k` values?***

## Predicting changes in animal movement during the current century

\noindent Rasters of projected monthly average temperature in BC from 2020 to 2100 were obtained via the `climatenaR` package [version 1.0, @burnett_climatenar_2023] for `R`. Since the climate projections only provided monthly means and ranges but no measures of variance or distributional assumptions, we used the hourly ERA5 data for BC from 1998 to 2023 [extremes included, see @hersbach_era5_2023] to calculate within-month variance, which we defined as the variance within a given pixel, month, and year. We then modelled the estimated variance using a GAM for location and scale [GAMLS, see @rigby_generalized_2005; @stasinopoulos_generalized_2007; section 7.9 in @wood_generalized_2017]. The linear predictor for the location (i.e., the mean) included smooth terms of the within-pixel monthly mean temperature (for each year), month (as a cyclic smooth), a two-dimensional smooth of space, and a tensor interaction product term of space and month. The linear predictor for the scale term (which governs the mean-variance relationship) included smooth terms of the monthly mean, month, and space. Additional details are available in Appendix C.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
m_gammals <- gam(list(
  monthly_var ~
    s(monthly_mean, bs = 'cr', k = 10) + # using cr to reduce fitting time
    s(month, bs = 'cc', k = 10) +
    s(long, lat, bs = 'ds', k = 500) +
    ti(long, lat, month, bs = c('ds', 'cc'), d = c(2, 1), k = c(100, 10)),
  ~ s(monthly_mean, bs = 'cr', k = 10) +
    s(month, bs = 'cc', k = 10) +
    s(long, lat, bs = 'ds', k = 100)),
  family = gammals(),
  data = d,
  method = 'REML',
  knots = list(month = c(0.5, 12.5)))
```

We simulated for hourly variation in weather by assuming temperature followed a normal distribution with mean specified by the `climatenaR` climate projections and variance as specified by the Gamma GAMLS. We then predicted changes in movement behavior and habitat selection as a function of temperature using the HGAMs and HRSFs along with the temperature HGAM described above. For each month within each year from 2020 to 2100, we simulated hourly weather by including temperatures from the 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.8, 0.9 quantiles and weighted each quantile proportionally to the (normalized) Gaussian probability density for each value (Appendix C).

## Effects of temperature on movement rates

\noindent The partial effects of temperature varied in both direction and magnitude across species (Fig. ***AX***), even after accounting for differences in daily and seasonal activity (e.g., sleeping, migration, hibernation; see Fig. ***AX***). Smooth interaction terms were well-behaved and indicated clear shifts in daily activity for all species (Fig. ***AX***). The models explained reasonably high proportions of the deviance (11% for the binomial model and 79% for the Gamma model) and had good in-sample prediction (Fig. ***AX***). Both movement frequency and speed when moving decreased with increasing sampling interval, with a strong common effect (Fig. ***AX***). Most species adapted their daily and seasonal movement behavior to changes in temperature (Fig. \@ref(fig:dist)), but the precision of the estimated change depends on the GPS sampling frequency. While `ctmm` models are scale independent [@noonan_scale-insensitive_2019], the accuracy, size, and stability of speed estimates still depends on the GPS sampling frequency. This is because coarser sampling contains information on large scale movements (e.g., range crossings, migrations) but not fine-scale movement (e.g., first-order habitat selection). Using the boreal caribou as an example, the 13-hour sampling interval allows us to reasonably estimate the caribou's movement path at a temporal scale of approximately 13 hours (or greater), but we cannot produce reasonable movement trajectories at a much finer (e.g., hourly) scale. Consequently, the estimated movement behaviors should be compared across species carefully.

### Predicted changes in movement during the current century

The direction and degree of change in distance travelled varies greatly between species, but worse climate-change scenarios consistently corresponded to greater absolute changes in behavior as well as greater uncertainty in the estimated change (Fig. \@ref(fig:t-dist)). Under the best-case scenario, absolute projected changes by 2100 were small (0% to 2%, except for southern mountain caribou, which had a change of ~5%). Under the worst-case scenario, absolute projected changes were by 2100 ranged from ~1% (boreal caribou) to ~25% (southern moutain caribou) and had the greatest uncertainty in the estimates. Boreal caribou and elk showed relatively little projected changes, especially relative to the degree of inter-annual variability in displacement.

# Discussion

* We discuss the consequences of these changes in movement behavior with regards to energetics, encounter rates, habitat conservation, and human-wildlife conflicts.
* as temperatures get warmer, we will be pushing into the unknown portion of the surface plots
* our models don’t include any physiological responses to temperature that may impact movement (e.g., hybernation)
* our models also assume the behaviour we modeled now will persist into the future (e.g., hybernation, migration)
* based on the model, temperature doesn't affect grizzlies' hibernation much, and their displacement in winter is very low due to P(moving) being so low:
* if the RSS decreases a lot, individuals may disperse, populations may relocate, or stay where they are and suffer

## Consequences for conservation

* improve projections at the edges of the HRSFs with local and Traditional Knowledge [@two-eyed_seeing_ref]
* changes in temperatures are pushing to areas in the surface plots that have little data and may be poorly estimated. We will need to extrapolate to prepare for future changes, which implies some degree of inevitable risk. The best wat to avoid this is by designing models that are statistically sound and interpretable. The models we present provide an estimate of the changes in behavior, but they are not tailored specifically to any of the species in the dataset. Species-specific models should account for more particular variables (e.g., forest age for caribou) and use dynamic resource rasters (i.e., not use a static estimate of forest cover). Nonetheless, we present important results for understanding how mammals will respond to changes in climate and weather during the next ~75 years. 
* energetics
* GPS sampling intervals were large: need more work on fine-scale movement, including accounting for multiple movement sates (e.g., traveling, grazing, resting, hunting, etc.). this would help deal with over-dispersion
* encounter rates (lower encounter rates with food [@hou_cold_2020])
* HWI
