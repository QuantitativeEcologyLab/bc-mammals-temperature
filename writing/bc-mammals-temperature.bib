	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Speed and distance traveled provide quantifiable links between behavior and energetics, and are among the metrics most routinely estimated from animal tracking data. Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements ({SLDs}) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, {SLD} estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty.
            
            
              Methods
              To overcome the limitations of {SLD} estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance ({CTSD}) estimation method. An inherent property of working in continuous-time is the ability to separate the underlying continuous-time movement process from the discrete-time sampling process, making these models less sensitive to the sampling schedule when estimating parameters. The first step of {CTSD} is to estimate the device’s error parameters to calibrate the measurement error. Once the errors have been calibrated, model selection techniques are employed to identify the best fit continuous-time movement model for the data. A simulation-based approach is then employed to sample from the distribution of trajectories conditional on the data, from which the mean speed estimate and its confidence intervals can be extracted.
            
            
              Results
              Using simulated data, we demonstrate how {CTSD} provides accurate, scale-insensitive estimates with reliable confidence intervals. When applied to empirical {GPS} data, we found that {SLD} estimates varied substantially with sampling frequency, whereas {CTSD} provided relatively consistent estimates, with often dramatic improvements over {SLD}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The methods described in this study allow for the computationally efficient, scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled, without biases due to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, or the amount of measurement error. In addition to being robust to the sampling schedule, the point estimates come equipped with confidence intervals, permitting formal statistical inference. All the methods developed in this study are now freely available in the  package or the  point-and-click web based graphical user interface.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.06.12.130195},
	abstract = {Abstract
          Animal tracking data are being collected more frequently, in greater detail, and on smaller taxa than ever before. These data hold the promise to increase the relevance of animal movement for understanding ecological processes, but this potential will only be fully realized if their accompanying location error is properly addressed. Historically, coarsely-sampled movement data have proved invaluable for understanding large scale processes (e.g., home range, habitat selection, etc.), but modern fine-scale data promise to unlock far more ecological information. While location error can often be ignored in coarsely sampled data, fine-scale data require much more care, and tools to do this have been lacking. Current approaches to dealing with location error largely fall into two categories—either discarding the least accurate location estimates prior to analysis or simultaneously fitting movement and error parameters in a hidden-state model. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have serious flaws. Here, we provide a general framework to account for location error in the analysis of animal tracking data, so that their potential can be unlocked. We apply our error-model-selection framework to 190 {GPS}, cellular, and acoustic devices representing 27 models from 14 manufacturers. Collectively, these devices are used to track a wide range of animal species comprising birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals of different sizes and with different behaviors, in urban, suburban, and wild settings. Then, using empirical data on tracked individuals from multiple species, we provide an overview of modern, error-informed movement analyses, including continuous-time path reconstruction, home-range distribution, home-range overlap, speed and distance estimation. Adding to these techniques, we introduce new error-informed estimators for outlier detection and autocorrelation visualization. We furthermore demonstrate how error-informed analyses on calibrated tracking data can be necessary to ensure that estimates are accurate and insensitive to location error, and allow researchers to use all of their data. Because error-induced biases depend on so many factors—sampling schedule, movement characteristics, tracking device, habitat, etc.—differential bias can easily confound biological inference and lead researchers to draw false conclusions.},

              For free-ranging animals living in seasonal environments, hypometabolism (lowered metabolic rate) and hypothermia (lowered body temperature) can be effective physiological strategies to conserve energy when forage resources are low. To what extent such strategies are adopted by large mammals living under extreme conditions, as those encountered in the high Arctic, is largely unknown, especially for species where the gestation period overlaps with the period of lowest resource availability (i.e. winter). Here we investigated for the first time the level to which high arctic muskoxen (
              Ovibos moschatus
              ) adopt hypothermia and tested the hypothesis that individual plasticity in the use of hypothermia depends on reproductive status. We measured core body temperature over most of the gestation period in both free-ranging muskox females in Greenland and captive female muskoxen in Alaska. We found divergent overwintering strategies according to reproductive status, where pregnant females maintained stable body temperatures during winter, while non-pregnant females exhibited a temporary decrease in their winter body temperature. These results show that muskox females use hypothermia during periods of resource scarcity, but also that the use of this strategy may be limited to non-reproducing females. Our findings suggest a trade-off between metabolically-driven energy conservation during winter and sustaining foetal growth, which may also apply to other large herbivores living in highly seasonal environments elsewhere.},

	abstract = {In a previous analysis, six major threats to at-risk species in Canada were quantified: habitat loss, introduced species, over-exploitation, pollution, native species interactions, and natural causes (O. Venter et al. 2006. Bioscience, 56(11): 903–910). Because of rapid environmental change in Canada and an enhanced understanding of the drivers of species endangerment, we updated the 2005 analysis and tested for changes in threats up until the end of 2018. We also expanded the scope to acknowledge climate change as a seventh major threat to species, given its increasing importance for reshaping biological communities. Using information on the {COSEWIC} (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) website, we scored the threats for each of 814 species. Habitat loss remained the most important anthropogenic threat to Canada’s at-risk species, affecting 82\% of species, followed by over-exploitation (47\%), introduced species (46\%), and pollution (35\%). Climate change was the least important threat, affecting only 13\% of species. However, report writers used less certain language when talking about climate change compared with other threats, so when we included cases where climate change was listed as a probable or future cause, climate change was the fourth most important anthropogenic threat, affecting some 38\% of species. The prevalence of threat categories was broadly similar to those for the United States and {IUCN} listed species. The taxa most affected by climate change included lichens (77\%), birds (63\%), marine mammals (60\%), and Arctic species of all taxa (79\%), whereas vascular plants (23\%), marine fishes (24\%), arthropods (27\%), and non-Arctic species (35\%) were least affected. A paired analysis of the 188 species with two or more reports indicated that any mention of climate change as a threat increased from 12\% to 50\% in 10 years. Other anthropogenic threats that have increased significantly over time in the paired analysis included introduced species, over-exploitation, and pollution. Our analysis suggests that threats are changing rapidly over time, emphasizing the need to monitor future trends of all threats, including climate change.},

Many different kinds of animals employ hibernation, and there is a spectrum of hibernation phenotypes. Here, we focus on obligatory mammalian hibernators to identify the unique challenges they face and the adaptations that allow hibernators to overcome them. This includes the cellular and molecular strategies used to combat low environmental and body temperatures and lack of food and water. We discuss metabolic, neuronal, and hormonal cues that regulate hibernation and how they are thought to be coordinated by internal clocks. Last, we touch on questions that are left to be addressed in the field of hibernation research. Studies from the last century and more recent work reveal that hibernation is not simply a passive reduction in body temperature and vital parameters but rather an active process seasonally regulated at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.},

              Torpor is a well-known energy conservation strategy in many mammal and bird species. It is often employed when environmental conditions are unfavourable to maximize survival probabilities. However, torpor often carries with it the physiological costs of a low body temperature and of rewarming in addition to potential missed opportunities for foraging. Therefore, we hypothesised that decision making regarding when to use torpor should reflect the most important environmental conditions for species distributions, and thus how they may be impacted by ongoing climate change. We investigated how weather conditions affect nightly torpor patterns in the nocturnal insectivorous Australian eastern long-eared bat (
              Nyctophilus bifax
              ). By measuring the skin temperature of 37 free-ranging individuals, we confirmed that torpor was used more frequently during the winter and at subtropical compared to tropical locations. Using mixed-effect models we show that lower ambient temperatures were the main driver of individual torpor use, probably due to lower roost temperatures and prey availability. However, increased rain, wind and humidity, and decreasing barometric pressure, as well as brighter moonlight, also led to more time spent torpid per night. We suggest that bats evaluate multiple environmental cues to make decisions regarding torpor use versus active foraging based upon their expectations of the energetic benefits, prey availability and relative predation risk. Interactions between some of these effects and body mass (whilst controlling for forearm length) indicate that individual variation in body size and/or state-dependent effects of energy reserves also partly determined the use of nightly torpor in these bats.},

            Biologists often cope with variation in physiological, environmental and ecological processes by measuring how living systems perform under average conditions. However, performance at average conditions is seldom equal to average performance across a range of conditions. This basic property of nonlinear averaging – known as ‘Jensen's inequality’ or ‘the fallacy of the average’ – has important implications for all of biology. For instance, a burgeoning awareness of Jensen's inequality has improved our ability to predict how plants and animals will respond to a warmer and more variable future climate. But for many biologists, the fallacy of the average is still a novel concept. Here, I highlight the importance of Jensen's inequality, provide a simple graphical approach to understanding its effects, and explore its consequences at atomic, molecular, organismal and ecological levels.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium , 4th century B.C.)},

	abstract = {Understanding animal movement is essential to elucidate how animals interact, survive, and thrive in a changing world. Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal “movement ecology” (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences. , Animal tracking in a big data world So-called “big-data” approaches have revolutionized fields of research from astronomy to genetics. Such approaches are not limited to fields that seem inherently technical, because the combination of rapid data collection and advanced analytical techniques could be applied to almost any scientific question. Nathan et al . reviewed how these modern approaches are being applied to the very old field of animal tracking and monitoring. Large-scale data collection can reveal details about how animals use their environment and interact with each other that were impossible to explore previously. Such methodological shifts will open new avenues of research—and conservation—across species. —{SNV} , A review suggests that modern “big-data” techniques are vastly increasing our understanding of animal movement and its ecology. , {BACKGROUND} Movement is ubiquitous across the natural world. All organisms move, actively or passively, regularly or during specific life stages, as a result of varied proximate drivers including energetic demands, social interactions, competition or predation. Movement closely interacts with individual fitness, affects a myriad of ecological processes, and is crucial for animals’ ability to cope with human-induced rapid environmental changes. Driven by advances in analytical methods and technologies for tracking mammals, birds, fish, and other free-ranging vertebrates (hereafter, wildlife), movement ecology is rapidly transforming into a data-rich discipline, following previous developments in fields such as genomics and environmental monitoring. This ongoing revolution is facilitated by cost-effective automated high-throughput wildlife tracking systems that generate massive high-resolution datasets across scales relevant to the ecological context in which animals perceive, interact with, and respond to their environment. {ADVANCES} Modern tracking technologies efficiently generate copious, accurate information on the movements of multiple individual animals in the wild. Reverse-{GPS} technologies, which primarily use acoustic signals under water and radio signals over land, are automated high-throughput systems that are highly cost- and power-effective and capable of simultaneous tracking of multiple small animals (e.g., 20-g birds) at high spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., 1-s interval, a few meters) for months, but they require system installation and are usually limited to regional scales (≤100 km wide). {GPS}-based systems are, by contrast, readily available, longer term, and cover nearly global scales, but are similarly spatially accurate and periodically capable of high-resolution tracking at regional scales. However, they are more cost- and power-demanding, limited to larger animals, and cannot be applied under water. Two other tracking technologies, radar and computer vision, permit high-resolution snapshots of the movement of multiple individuals and can noninvasively track nontagged animals, but are less cost-effective, usually limited to smaller scales, and make individual identification challenging. Combined, these high-throughput technologies enable groundbreaking research in animal behavior, cognitive sciences, evolution, and ecology, facilitating previously infeasible investigation of animal movement ecology. Big movement data can help link interindividual variation in movement to individual behavior, traits, cognition and physiology; divulge fine-scale interactions within or among species; improve evidence-based management of human-wildlife interactions; and elucidate behavioral changes across spatiotemporal scales. {OUTLOOK} High-throughput wildlife tracking technologies are opening new research frontiers in biology and ecology. Their advantages, however, come with typical big-data costs such as computational load, intensive data management and processing, and challenging statistical analyses. Enlisting fields with a longer history of big data offers new prospects to address these challenges. Progress will arise from combining observational and experimental movement ecology and data-rich studies revealing behavioral shifts across individuals, species, scales, ecosystems, and life stages. High-resolution wildlife tracking is currently infeasible at large to global scales, a key limitation that can be addressed by combining low- and high-rate sampling, increasing interoperability between technologies, standardizing and sharing data, and promoting multidisciplinary international collaboration. Coupling movement and environmental big data could help determine impacts of major environmental and climate changes on animal–environment interactions, whereas real-time movement data could uniquely inform biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Why do high-throughput movement data matter? Big movement data are essential for addressing key ecological questions, as conclusions based on traditional lower-resolution data could differ markedly from the correct conclusions. We illustrate several examples for contrasting conclusions derived from lower- versus higher-resolution data of the same tracks from the same number of animals. Higher-resolution data can reveal that bolder birds visit more sites across the landscape and that bird tracks frequently cross each other, suggesting high potential for disease transmission, and that fish avoid fisheries and frequently search locally within small patches. None of these conclusions, however, could have been drawn from lower-resolution data. See also movies S1 to S5.},

	abstract = {Abstract In social animals, areas where the home ranges of neighboring groups overlap are often underused. The Risk Hypothesis posits that the costs of intergroup conflict create a “landscape of fear,” discouraging the use of such shared areas. To test this hypothesis, we observed the behavior of white-faced capuchins ( Cebus capucinus ) in central vs. peripheral areas of their home ranges. If capuchins perceive areas of home range overlap as “risky,” we predicted they would change activity budgets, vocalization rates, and foraging behavior in these areas. A spatially explicit behavioral comparison based on nearly 100 h of focal follows revealed that capuchins socialize less in the periphery (vs. the center) of their home range. Time spent resting, foraging, and engaging in vigilance, as well as vocalization rates, varied in consistent ways across all four study groups, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Fruit trees near range borders (vs. the center) contained more ripe fruit, and groups spent more time in these trees, with more individuals entering to feed and consuming more fruits. However, capuchins did not alter their foraging behavior in potentially risky peripheral areas in a manner consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory: intake rates at patch departure were not significantly lower and groups depleted trees to a greater extent along the periphery vs. in the center of their range. These results suggest that while peripheral areas are perceived as risky and this “landscape of fear” contributes to behavioral changes, they also provide resources whose value may outweigh the cost of intergroup encounters.},

            During deep snow conditions, wildlife must balance between minimizing movements to conserve energy while seeking high amounts of browse to gain the energy. Knowledge of how snow begins to hinder their movements is therefore vital when predicting their wintertime behavior. We assessed the phenomenon with moose. Movement data from 122 {GPS}-collared moose were integrated with snow depth data from designated measurement stations. The effects of increasing snow depths on moose movement rates were then modeled with spline regression. The study was conducted in Finland, between 2009 and 2011. The moose were known for their sex and for the presence of calf at heel. On average, the movement rates decreased sharply until snow depths of ca. 30–40 cm, after which further significant decreases were not seen. The movement rates decreased from several kilometers per day to less than 500 m per day. Moose in the northernmost study area with the deepest snow covers moved as much as the moose in the other areas with less snow. Although we saw differences in the movement rates between males and females, differences between individuals were markedly higher than those caused by sex or a calf at heel. Moose are keystone species whose heavy browsing, especially during winter, can have profound effects on vegetation and forest regeneration. As snow covers in large parts of the boreal zone are predicted to decrease due to warming climate, the wintertime movements of moose and how they affect the local vegetation will remain relevant questions.},

              Endangered species laws effectively prevent species extinction but fall short in restoring abundance for culturally important species. Legal agreements between Indigenous peoples and countries recognize the importance of abundant, culturally important species that disproportionately contribute to peoples’ food, material, spirituality, and sense of place (

Despite this, recovery targets under endangered species laws do not account for such abundance, instead targeting minimum viable population ({MVP}) sizes that leave many species in a state of reduced abundance compared with their historical baselines. Using three keystone species in North America—caribou, bison, and salmon—we explore the implications of the gap between culturally meaningful abundance and minimum viable populations and argue for the need to establish recovery targets and processes that restore abundance beyond {MVPs}. Braiding endangered species law and Indigenous rights will help countries uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples, prevent species extinction, and ultimately provide benefits to society at large.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study : speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable.
            This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores ; four species of primates ; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species):
            
            where has the units ml O2 s−1 kg−1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s−1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Ėmetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20·1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible :
            
            where Ėmetab/Mb has the units watts/kg.
            This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \& Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this general equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25 \% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.},

	abstract = {The frequency and magnitude of weather extreme events have increased significantly during the past few years in response to anthropogenic climate change. However, global statistical characteristics and underlying physical mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we adopt a statistical physics and probability theory based method to investigate the nature of extreme weather events, particularly the statistics of the day-to-day air temperature differences. These statistical measurements reveal that the distributions of the magnitudes of the extreme events satisfy a universal {\textbackslash}textit\{Gumbel\} distribution, while the waiting time of those extreme events is governed by a universal {\textbackslash}textit\{Gamma\} function. Further finite-size effects analysis indicates robust scaling behaviours. We additionally unveil that the cumulative distribution of logarithmic waiting times between the record events follows an {\textbackslash}textit\{Exponential\} distribution and that the evolution of this climate system is directional where the underlying dynamics are related to a decelerating release of tension. The universal scaling laws are remarkably stable and unaffected by global warming. Counterintuitively, unlike as expected for record dynamics, we find that the number of quakes of the extreme temperature variability does not decay as one over time but with deviations relevant to large-scale climate extreme events. Our theoretical framework provides a fresh perspective on the linkage of universality, scaling, and climate systems. The findings throw light on the nature of the weather variabilities and could guide us to better forecast extreme events.},

            A spatially explicit capture-recapture ({SCR}) model was applied to estimate simultaneously population parameters and individual activity (i.e. home range size) of O. vulgaris, based on experimental mark-recapture data in a human-altered Mediterranean coastal area. Seventy-two octopuses were captured, tagged with subcutaneous {PIT}-tags and released. Nineteen tagged individuals were recaptured (recapture rate: 26.4\%) in the same area over the study period, which spanned over 6 months. Population sizes and densities decreased over the study period, from 337 octopuses (8 ind. ha−1) in September-October to 105 octopuses (2.5 ind. ha−1) in February-March. The highest recruitment probability was estimated to occur at the beginning of the study but it clearly decreased over time, while mortality probability during a fishing period slightly increased. Mean specific growth rate was 0.82 ± 0.11 day−1. Individual home range or activity area ranged from 2.8 ha to 7.3 ha (median home range radius: 121.8 m). Overall, these results suggest that human-altered coastal habitats, which are characterized by abundant shelters, abundant food and absence of predators, can act as settlement and growth areas for juveniles and adults of O. vulgaris. Furthermore, the methodologies applied in this study are recommended as innovative tools to improve management actions of coastal resources.},

The success of the {NAM} is both celebrated and refuted amongst scholars, with most arguing that a more holistic approach is needed. Colonial rhetoric permeates each of the {NAM}’s constituent tenets—yet, beyond these cultural and historical problems are the {NAM}’s underlying conservation values. In many ways, these values share common ground with various Indigenous worldviews. For example, the idea of safeguarding wildlife for future generations, utilizing best available knowledge to solve problems, prioritizing collaboration between nations, and democratizing the process of conserving wildlife all overlap in the many ways that the {NAM} and common models of Indigenous-led conservation are operationalized. Working to identify shared visions and address necessary amendments of the {NAM} will advance reconciliation, both in the interest of nature and society. Here, we identify the gaps and linkages between the {NAM} and Indigenous-led conservation efforts across Canada. We impart a revised {NAM}—the Indigenizing North American Model of Wildlife Conservation (I-{NAM})—that interweaves various Indigenous worldviews and conservation practice from across Canada. We emphasize that the I-{NAM} should be a continuous learning process that seeks to update and coexist with the {NAM}, but not replace Indigenous-led conservation.},

Without personal connections to Indigenous communities, many Canadians fail to grasp the depth of intergenerational impacts of residential schools and associated systemic racism. Consequently, reconciliation remains an elusive concept. Here we outline 10 Calls to Action to natural scientists to enable reconciliation in their work. We focus on natural scientists because a common connection to the land should tie the social license of natural scientists more closely to Indigenous communities than currently exists. We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights. These 10 Calls to Action challenge the scientific community to recognize that reconciliation requires a new way of conducting natural science, one that includes and respects Indigenous communities, rights, and knowledge leading to better scientific and community outcomes.},

	abstract = {The green wave hypothesis ({GWH}) states that migrating animals should track or ‘surf’ high-quality forage at the leading edge of spring green-up. To index such high-quality forage, recent work proposed the instantaneous rate of green-up ({IRG}), i.e. rate of change in the normalized difference vegetation index over time. Despite this important advancement, no study has tested the assumption that herbivores select habitat patches at peak {IRG}. We evaluated this assumption using step selection functions parametrized with movement data during the green-up period from two populations each of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, moose and bison, totalling 463 individuals monitored 1–3 years from 2004 to 2014. Accounting for variables that typically influence habitat selection for each species, we found seven of 10 populations selected patches exhibiting high {IRG}—supporting the {GWH}. Nonetheless, large herbivores selected for the leading edge, trailing edge and crest of the {IRG} wave, indicating that other mechanisms (e.g. ruminant physiology) or measurement error inherent with satellite data affect selection for {IRG}. Our evaluation indicates that {IRG} is a useful tool for linking herbivore movement with plant phenology, paving the way for significant advancements in understanding how animals track resource quality that varies both spatially and temporally.},

            Tracking seasonally changing resources is regarded as a widespread proximate mechanism underpinning animal migration. Migrating herbivores, for example, are hypothesized to track seasonal foliage dynamics over large spatial scales. Previous investigations of this green wave hypothesis involved few species and limited geographical extent, and used conventional correlation that cannot disentangle alternative correlated effects. Here, we introduce stochastic simulations to test this hypothesis using 222 individual spring migration episodes of 14 populations of ten species of geese, swans and dabbling ducks throughout Europe, East Asia, and North America. We find that the green wave cannot be considered a ubiquitous driver of herbivorous waterfowl spring migration, as it explains observed migration patterns of only a few grazing populations in specific regions. We suggest that ecological barriers and particularly human disturbance likely constrain the capacity of herbivorous waterfowl to track the green wave in some regions, highlighting key challenges in conserving migratory birds.},

We used infrared thermography to explore how lower passive heat dissipation during flight impacts body-heat management in broad-billed (

Thermal gradients persisted at higher temperatures in smaller species, possibly allowing them to inhabit warmer sites. All species experienced extended daytime periods lacking thermal gradients. Broad-billed hummingbirds lacking thermal gradients regulated the mean total-body surface temperature at approximately 38°C, suggesting behavioural thermoregulation. Blue-throated hummingbirds were inactive when lacking passive heat dissipation and hence might have the lowest temperature tolerance of the four species. Use of thermal refugia permitted hummingbirds to tolerate higher temperatures, but climate change could eliminate refugia, forcing distributional shifts in hummingbird populations.},

	abstract = {Movement is critical to animal survival and, thus, biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Increasing fragmentation in the Anthropocene necessitates predictions about the movement capacities of the multitude of species that inhabit natural ecosystems. This requires mechanistic, trait-based animal locomotion models, which are sufficiently general as well as biologically realistic. While larger animals should generally be able to travel greater distances, reported trends in their maximum speeds across a range of body sizes suggest limited movement capacities among the largest species. Here, we show that this also applies to travel speeds and that this arises because of their limited heat-dissipation capacities. We derive a model considering how fundamental biophysical constraints of animal body mass associated with energy utilisation (i.e., larger animals have a lower metabolic energy cost of locomotion) and heat-dissipation (i.e., larger animals require more time to dissipate metabolic heat) limit aerobic travel speeds. Using an extensive empirical dataset of animal travel speeds (532 species), we show that this
              allometric heat-dissipation model
              best captures the hump-shaped trends in travel speed with body mass for flying, running, and swimming animals. This implies that the inability to dissipate metabolic heat leads to the saturation and eventual decrease in travel speed with increasing body mass as larger animals must reduce their realised travel speeds in order to avoid hyperthermia during extended locomotion bouts. As a result, the highest travel speeds are achieved by animals of intermediate body mass, suggesting that the largest species are more limited in their movement capacities than previously anticipated. Consequently, we provide a mechanistic understanding of animal travel speed that can be generalised across species, even when the details of an individual species’ biology are unknown, to facilitate more realistic predictions of biodiversity dynamics in fragmented landscapes.},

            The Earth's surface temperature is rising, and precipitation patterns throughout the Earth are changing; the source of these shifts is likely anthropogenic in nature. Alterations in temperature and precipitation have obvious direct and indirect effects on both plants and animals. Notably, changes in temperature and precipitation alone can have both advantageous and detrimental consequences depending on the species. Typically, production of offspring is timed to coincide with optimal food availability; thus, individuals of many species display annual rhythms of reproductive function. Because it requires substantial time to establish or re‐establish reproductive function, individuals cannot depend on the arrival of seasonal food availability to begin breeding; thus, mechanisms have evolved in many plants and animals to monitor and respond to day length in order to anticipate seasonal changes in the environment. Over evolutionary time, there has been precise fine‐tuning of critical photoperiod and onset/offset of seasonal adaptations. Climate change has provoked changes in the availability of insects and plants which shifts the timing of optimal reproduction. However, adaptations to the stable photoperiod may be insufficiently plastic to allow a shift in the seasonal timing of bird and mammal breeding. Coupled with the effects of light pollution which prevents these species from determining day length, climate change presents extreme evolutionary pressure that can result in severe deleterious consequences for individual species reproduction and survival. This review describes the effects of climate change on plants and animals, defines photoperiod and the physiological events it regulates, and addresses the consequences of global climate change and a stable photoperiod.},

                  Climate warming creates energetic challenges for endothermic species by increasing metabolic and hydric costs of thermoregulation. Although endotherms can invoke an array of behavioural and physiological strategies for maintaining homeostasis, the relative effectiveness of those strategies in a climate that is becoming both warmer and drier is not well understood.
                
                
                  In accordance with the heat dissipation limit theory which suggests that allocation of energy to growth and reproduction by endotherms is constrained by the ability to dissipate heat, we expected that patterns of habitat use by large, heat‐sensitive mammals across multiple scales are critical for behavioural thermoregulation during periods of potential heat stress and that they must invest a large portion of time to maintain heat balance.
                
                
                  
                    To test our predictions, we evaluated mechanisms underpinning the effectiveness of bed sites for ameliorating daytime heat loads and potential heat stress across the landscape while accounting for other factors known to affect behaviour. We integrated detailed data on microclimate and animal attributes of moose
                    Alces alces
                    , into a biophysical model to quantify costs of thermoregulation at fine and coarse spatial scales.
                  
                
                
                  During summer, moose spent an average of 67.8\% of daylight hours bedded, and selected bed sites and home ranges that reduced risk of experiencing heat stress. For most of the day, shade could effectively mitigate the risk of experiencing heat stress up to 10°C, but at warmer temperatures (up to 20°C) wet soil was necessary to maintain homeostasis via conductive heat loss. Consistent selection across spatial scales for locations that reduced heat load underscores the importance of the thermal environment as a driver of behaviour in this heat‐sensitive mammal.
                
                
                  Moose in North America have long been characterized as riparian‐obligate species because of their dependence on woody plant species for food. Nevertheless, the importance of dissipating endogenous heat loads conductively through wet soil suggests riparian habitats also are critical thermal refuges for moose. Such refuges may be especially important in the face of a warming climate in which both high environmental temperatures and drier conditions will likely exacerbate limits to heat dissipation, especially for large, heat‐sensitive animals.},

The study of the hypothalamic neuromodulation of thermoregulation offers broad areas of opportunity with practical applications that are currently being strengthened by the availability of efficacious tools like infrared thermography ({IRT}). These areas could include the following: understanding the effect of climate change on behavior and productivity; analyzing the effects of exercise on animals involved in sporting activities; identifying the microvascular changes that occur in response to fear, pleasure, pain, and other situations that induce stress in animals; and examining thermoregulating behaviors. This research could contribute substantially to understanding the drastic modification of environments that have severe consequences for animals, such as loss of appetite, low productivity, neonatal hypothermia, and thermal shock, among others. Current knowledge of these physiological processes and complex anatomical structures, like the nervous systems and their close relation to mechanisms of thermoregulation, is still limited. The results of studies in fields like evolutionary neuroscience of thermoregulation show that we cannot yet objectively explain even processes that on the surface seem simple, including behavioral changes and the pathways and connections that trigger mechanisms like vasodilatation and panting. In addition, there is a need to clarify the connection between emotions and thermoregulation that increases the chances of survival of some organisms. An increasingly precise understanding of thermoregulation will allow us to design and apply practical methods in fields like animal science and clinical medicine without compromising levels of animal welfare. The results obtained should not only increase the chances of survival but also improve quality of life and animal production.},

Model projections indicate significant variations in future climate conditions of North America, and the habitats of woodland mammals of this continent may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate.
                
                
                  We report on the potential spatial distributions of 13 wide‐ranging, relatively common species of North American woodland mammals under future climate scenarios.
                
                
                  We examined the potential influence of the mean and seasonal climate variables on the distribution of species. Presence‐only occurrence records of species, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5), and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species’ distribution models using a maximum entropy algorithm ({MaxEnt}).

	abstract = {Among agents of selection that shape phenotypic traits in animals, humans can cause more rapid changes than many natural factors. Studies have focused on human selection of morphological traits, but little is known about human selection of behavioural traits. By monitoring elk (
              Cervus elaphus
              ) with satellite telemetry, we tested whether individuals harvested by hunters adopted less favourable behaviours than elk that survived the hunting season. Among 45 2-year-old males, harvested elk showed bolder behaviour, including higher movement rate and increased use of open areas, compared with surviving elk that showed less conspicuous behaviour. Personality clearly drove this pattern, given that inter-individual differences in movement rate were present before the onset of the hunting season. Elk that were harvested further increased their movement rate when the probability of encountering hunters was high (close to roads, flatter terrain, during the weekend), while elk that survived decreased movements and showed avoidance of open areas. Among 77 females (2–19 y.o.), personality traits were less evident and likely confounded by learning because females decreased their movement rate with increasing age. As with males, hunters typically harvested females with bold behavioural traits. Among less-experienced elk (2–9 y.o.), females that moved faster were harvested, while elk that moved slower and avoided open areas survived. Interestingly, movement rate decreased as age increased in those females that survived, but not in those that were eventually harvested. The latter clearly showed lower plasticity and adaptability to the local environment. All females older than 9 y.o. moved more slowly, avoided open areas and survived. Selection on behavioural traits is an important but often-ignored consequence of human exploitation of wild animals. Human hunting could evoke exploitation-induced evolutionary change, which, in turn, might oppose adaptive responses to natural and sexual selection.},

While this never happens now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 °C, calling the habitability of some regions into question. With 11–12 °C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12 °C are possible from fossil fuel burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record.},

With this information in hand, biologists can predict organisms most at risk from environmental change. Biologists and managers can then target organisms and habitats most at risk. Unfortunately, the required data (e.g. optimal physiological temperatures) are rarely available. Here, we evaluate the reliability of potential proxies (e.g. critical temperatures) that are often available for some groups. Several proxies for ectotherms are promising, but analogous ones for endotherms are lacking. We also develop a simple graphical model of how behavioural thermoregulation, acclimation and adaptation may interact to influence vulnerability over time. After considering this model together with the proxies available for physiological sensitivity to climate change, we conclude that ectotherms sharing vulnerability traits seem concentrated in lowland tropical forests. Their vulnerability may be exacerbated by negative biotic interactions. Whether tropical forest (or other) species can adapt to warming environments is unclear, as genetic and selective data are scant. Nevertheless, the prospects for tropical forest ectotherms appear grim.},

Global weirding embraces all phenomena associated with climate change: increases in average temperatures, heat waves, cold spells, floods, droughts, hurricanes, blizzards, plant and animal die-offs, population explosions, new animal migration patterns, plus dramatic regional differences. Current data suggest that many alpine species will be lost to changes in habitat wrought by climate, particularly increases in average temperatures. For many wetlands, particularly in the central and southern interior of the province, the basic issue is simple—the incoming water is decreasing and the outgoing water (evaporation) is increasing. The authors illustrate three approaches to projecting trends in wetland habitat, elaborating on the “drying index” approach, in which they have most confidence. For wetland species, they say management will struggle with the concept of a real-world triage—allocating conservation efforts where they are most likely to succeed and have the most benefit. They conclude that several conservation approaches for wetland species will face the difficulty of allocating water between needs of these species and of humans.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A set of 182 populations of 76 mammal species in the United States and Canada, examined in natural conditions with minimized disturbances or management effects, shows that responses to climate change include negative responses, such as elevational range contractions, upward shifts and decreases in abundance, positive responses, such as range expansions, and no detectable responses. Responses vary among and within mammal species but many are correlated with species traits, particularly the responses linked to high extinction risks (= climate change risk: decreases in population sizes, range contractions, local extirpations). The traits showing the strongest links to differential responses to climate change are 1) body size—large mammals respond more often and most negatively to climate change, 2) activity times—few mammals with flexible active times respond to climate change, and 3) spatial distribution—high-latitude and high-elevation mammals responded more often to climate change. Using these traits and two approaches to trait weighting, I modeled the relative climate change risk for all 328 terrestrial, nonvolant mammal species in the United States and Canada across 10 levels of risk (low = 1–2, moderate = 3–4, moderate-high = 5–6, high = 7–8, very high = 9–10). The models predicted that 15\% of these mammalian species are in the high- and very high-risk categories, including species from most orders. Many mammal populations and species listed as of conservation concern due to other human impacts by national or international agencies are also predicted by my models to be in the higher categories of climate change risk. My intention for these models is to clarify for managers and researchers which, where, and how mammals are responding to climate change relatively independent of other anthropogenic stressors (e.g., large-scale habitat change, overhunting) and to provide a preliminary assessment of species most in need of careful monitoring for climate change impacts.},

            Animal migrations occur in many taxa and are considered an adaptive response to spatial or temporal variations in resources. Human activities can influence the cost-benefit trade-offs of animal migrations, but evaluating the determinants of migration trajectory and movement rate in declining populations facing relatively low levels of human disturbance can provide new and valuable insights on the behavior of wildlife in natural environments. Here, we used an adapted version of path selection functions and quantified the effects of habitat type, topography, and weather, on 313 spring migrations by migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in northern Québec, Canada, from 2011 to 2018. Our results showed that during spring migration, caribou selected tundra and avoided water bodies, forest, and higher elevation. Higher precipitation and deeper snow were linked to lower movement rates. Weather variables had a stronger effect on the migration trajectories and movement rates of females than males. Duration of caribou spring migration (mean of 48 days) and length (mean of 587 km) were similar in males and females, but females started (22 April) and ended (10 June) spring migrations ca. 6 days earlier than males. Caribou spring migration was influenced by habitat type, topography, and weather, but we also observed that caribou migrations were not spatially constrained. Better knowledge on where and when animals move between their winter and summer ranges can help inform management and land planning decisions. Our results could be used to model future migration trajectories and speed of caribou under different climate change scenarios.},

              Aim
              Range shift is a relatively well‐understood response to climate change, but our ability to predict shifts is limited. Two factors that may cause variation in range shifts across species are dispersal ability and varying rates of climate change through time and across space. Here, we assess patterns of range shifts during the late Quaternary and estimate how the velocity of climate change and the dispersal ability of a species affect the magnitude of species range shifts in response to climate change.
            
            
              Location
              North America.
            
            
              Methods
              We hindcast species distribution models for 122 North American mammals to five times over the past 17,000 years and forecast them to two future times given two emissions scenarios. Generalized additive models were constructed to quantify the importance of dispersal ability and the velocity of temperature and precipitation in determining the magnitude of range shift expected for individual species.
            
            
              Results
              
                Hindcasted and forecasted ranges demonstrate the variety of responses to climate change. In general, species shifted their ranges in a northerly direction (
                {NW}
                , N,
                {NE}
                ) regardless of the type of climate change (i.e., warming vs. cooling). The highest rates of range shifts during the past occurred during periods of relatively rapid climate change (Last Glacial Maximum/Bølling‐Allerød and Bølling‐Allerød/Younger Dryas transitions). Rates of range shifts for the future are projected to be significantly higher than any of the past intervals. The velocity of climate change is significantly associated with the magnitude of range shifts during climate transitions that occur over longer time‐scales, while maximum dispersal distance is important during periods of rapid climate change.
              
            
            
              Main Conclusions
              Our results suggest that both the dispersal ability and the velocity of climate change are significantly associated with species’ range shifts. However, the importance of these two factors is context‐dependent and depends on the interaction of the rate of climate change and the length of time over which the change occurs.},

                How organisms respond to and are influenced by temperature is one of the most fundamental aspects of ecology. Temperature affects animal physiology, behavior, survival, and reproduction. At broader spatial and temporal scales, temperature affects animal distributions, speciation, and evolution. Although entire textbooks have been devoted to how temperature is related to various aspects of basic animal ecology, applied ecologists have only recently begun to address thermal ecology in wildlife research. New investigations of thermal conditions relative to specific wildlife species have generally found tremendous variation within landscapes. Consequently, multiple species have been shown to respond in predictive ways to thermal variation. Variation in temperature can be due to both topoedaphic features inherent in the landscape as well as differences in vegetation structure and composition resulting from management actions. Although consideration of the thermal environment has received consideration for exothermic species, new evidence indicates that it has major implications to endotherms and may become even more critical under novel climate conditions. Rarely does management consider thermal cover explicitly or in a spatiotemporally dynamic way; in our view, this is a major short‐coming of current conservation planning and management actions. We argue that thermal environments should be foundational in the understanding of the habitat concept. Furthermore, restoration and management efforts should specifically consider thermal refuge and pinch points—the discrete time or event when thermal conditions experienced by an organism deviate to extreme values relative to average conditions and limit vital rates and space use of that organism. We suggest that future research on thermal environments work at scales relevant to organisms so that management can adequately address the full extent of a species’ habitat. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {The spatial scale at which an environmental variable is summarized can have considerable impacts on ecological inference of species distribution and abundance. While several analytical approaches have emerged to determine biologically relevant spatial scales – the spatial scale that most strongly influences the ecological patterns observed – identifying key ecological drivers of scale of effect is still underway. Additionally, several predicted ecological drivers of scale of effect can vary across space and time, but little research on spatiotemporal patterns has occurred. Here, I assessed spatial and temporal variation in scales of effect across 32 North American bird species using 18 years of empirical data from the North American breeding bird survey. Scale estimation was then coupled with trait‐based analyses and hypotheses testing of underlying processes of spatial and temporal variation in scales of effect. All 32 species tested exhibited varied scales of effect across years (average annual scales of effect ranging from 0.2 to 4.97 km) and Bird Conservation Regions ({BCR}), with spatial variability being the most pronounced. Trait‐based analyses revealed a contrary relationship between hand‐wing index, body size, and scale of effect, though the strength of this relationship was contingent on migratory status. Temporal variation in scales of effect was best explained by changes in human development over time, indicating that avian space use can be explained by an increasing human footprint. Additionally, relative population size, consistent with theoretical predictions stemming from density‐dependent population dynamics, explained notable variation in spatial and temporal scales of effect. These findings contribute to the growing landscape ecology literature by providing empirical evidence for hypothesized drivers of scales of effect. By delineating species‐specific scales of effect and elucidating their ecological drivers, this study enhances our understanding of spatial and temporal scales in ecological processes, aiding conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.},

(J Am Stat Assoc 112(519):1199–1210, 2017) developed methods for fitting penalized regression spline based generalized additive models, with of the order of \$\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$\$ coefficients, to up to \$\$10{\textasciicircum}8\$\$ data. The methods offered two to three orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost relative to the most efficient previous methods. Part of the gain resulted from the development of a set of methods for efficiently computing model matrix products when model covariates each take only a discrete set of values substantially smaller than the sample size [generalizing an idea first appearing in Lang et al. (Stat Comput 24(2):223–238, 2014)]. Covariates can always be rounded to achieve such discretization, and it should be noted that the covariate discretization is marginal. That is we do not rely on discretizing covariates jointly, which would typically require the use of very coarse discretization. The most expensive computation in model estimation is the formation of the matrix cross product \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{T\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{WX}\}\}\$\$ where \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}\$\$ is a model matrix and \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{W\}\}\$\$ a diagonal or tri-diagonal matrix. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple, novel and substantially more efficient approach to the computation of this cross product. The new method offers, for example, a 30 fold reduction in cross product computation time for the Black Smoke model dataset motivating Wood et al. (2017). Given this reduction in computational cost, the subsequent Cholesky decomposition of \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{T\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{WX}\}\}\$\$ and follow on computation of \$\$({\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{T\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{WX}\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$\$ become a more significant part of the computational burden, and we also discuss the choice of methods for improving their speed.},

	abstract = {Habitat selection models frequently use data collected from a small geographic area over a short window of time to extrapolate patterns of relative abundance into unobserved areas or periods of time. However, such models often poorly predict the distribution of animal space‐use intensity beyond the place and time of data collection, presumably because space‐use behaviors vary between individuals and environmental contexts. Similarly, ecological inference based on habitat selection models could be muddied or biased due to unaccounted individual and context dependencies. Here, we present a modeling workflow designed to allow transparent variance‐decomposition of habitat‐selection patterns, and consequently improved inferential and predictive capacities. Using global positioning system ({GPS}) data collected from 238 individual pronghorn,
              Antilocapra americana
              , across three years in Utah, {USA}, we combine individual‐year‐season‐specific exponential habitat‐selection models with weighted mixed‐effects regressions to both draw inference about the drivers of habitat selection and predict space‐use in areas/times where/when pronghorn were not monitored. We found a tremendous amount of variation in both the magnitude and direction of habitat selection behavior across seasons, but also across individuals, geographic regions, and years. We were able to attribute portions of this variation to season, movement strategy, sex, and regional variability in resources, conditions, and risks. We were also able to partition residual variation into inter‐ and intra‐individual components. We then used the results to predict population‐level, spatially and temporally dynamic, habitat‐selection coefficients across Utah, resulting in a temporally dynamic map of pronghorn distribution at a 30 × 30 m resolution but an extent of 220 000 km
              2
              . We believe our transferable workflow can provide managers and researchers alike a way to turn limitations of traditional habitat selection models – variability in habitat selection – into a tool to understand and predict species‐habitat associations across space and time.},

Such studies frequently involve either individually indexed locations gathered across limited spatial extents and analyzed using resource selection functions ({RSFs}) or spatially extensive locational data without individual resolution typically analyzed using species distribution models. Both analytical methodologies have certain desirable features, but analyses that combine individual‐ and population‐level inference with flexible non‐linear functions may provide improved predictions while accounting for individual variation. Here, we describe how {RSFs} can be fit using hierarchical generalized additive models ({HGAMs}) using widely available software, providing a means to explore individual variation in habitat associations and to generate species distribution maps. We used {GPS} tracking data from golden eagles
              Aquila chrysaetos
              from across eastern North America with four environmental predictors to generate monthly distribution models. We considered three model structures that assumed different amounts of individual variation in the functional relationship between predictors and habitat use and used
              k
              ‐fold cross‐validation to compare model performance. Models accounting for individual variability in shape and smoothness of functional responses performed best. Eagles exhibited the least amount of individual variation in response to land cover variables during winter months, with most individuals more closely adhering to the population‐level trend. During the summer months, eagles exhibited more substantial individual variation in shape and smoothness of the functional relationships, suggesting some need to account for individual variation in eagle habitat use for both inferential and predictive purposes, during this time of year. Because they allow users to blend flexible functions with random effects structures and are well‐supported by a variety of software platforms, we believe that {HGAMs} provide a useful addition to the suite of analyses used for modeling habitat associations or predicting species distributions.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            The energetic cost of locomotion can be a substantial proportion of an animal's daily energy budget and thus key to its ecology. Studies on myriad species have added to our knowledge about the general cost of animal movement, including the effects of variations in the environment such as terrain angle. However, further such studies might provide diminishing returns on the development of a deeper understanding of how animals trade-off the cost of movement with other energy costs, and other ecological currencies such as time. Here, I propose the ‘individual energy landscape’ as an approach to conceptualising the choices facing the optimising animal. In this Commentary, first I outline previous broad findings about animal walking and running locomotion, focusing in particular on the use of net cost of transport as a metric of comparison between species, and then considering the effects of environmental perturbations and other extrinsic factors on movement costs. I then introduce and explore the idea that these factors combine with the behaviour of the animal in seeking short-term optimality to create that animal's individual energy landscape – the result of the geographical landscape and environmental factors combined with the animal's selected trade-offs. Considering an animal's locomotion energy expenditure within this context enables hard-won empirical data on transport costs to be applied to questions about how an animal can and does move through its environment to maximise its fitness, and the relative importance, or otherwise, of locomotion energy economy.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            Motion is a crucial part of the natural world, yet our understanding of how animals avoid predation whilst moving remains rather limited. Although several theories have been proposed for how antipredator defence may be facilitated during motion, there is often a lack of supporting empirical evidence, or conflicting findings. Furthermore, many studies have shown that motion often ‘breaks’ camouflage, as sudden movement can be detected even before an individual is recognised. Whilst some static camouflage strategies may conceal moving animals to a certain extent, more emphasis should be given to other modes of camouflage and related defences in the context of motion (e.g. flicker fusion camouflage, active motion camouflage, motion dazzle, and protean motion). Furthermore, when motion is involved, defence strategies are not necessarily limited to concealment. An animal can also rely on motion to mislead predators with regards to its trajectory, location, size, colour pattern, or even identity. In this review, we discuss the various underlying antipredator strategies and the mechanisms through which they may be linked to motion, conceptualising existing empirical and theoretical studies from two perspectives – concealing and misleading effects. We also highlight gaps in our understanding of these antipredator strategies, and suggest possible methodologies for experimental designs/test subjects (i.e. prey and/or predators) and future research directions.},

              The collective dynamics of self-organised systems emerge from the decision rules agents use to respond to each other and to external forces. This is evident in groups of animals under attack from predators, where understanding collective escape patterns requires evaluating the risks and rewards associated with particular social rules, prey escape behaviour, and predator attack strategies. Here, we find that the emergence of the ‘fountain effect’, a common collective pattern observed when animal groups evade predators, is the outcome of rules designed to maximise individual survival chances given predator hunting decisions. Using drone-based empirical observations of schooling sardine prey (
              Sardinops sagax caerulea
              ) attacked by striped marlin (
              Kajikia audax
              ), we first find the majority of attacks produce fountain effects, with the dynamics of these escapes dependent on the predator’s attack direction. Then, using a spatially-explicit agent-based model of predator-prey dynamics, we show that fountain manoeuvres can emerge from combining an optimal individual prey escape angle with social interactions. The escape rule appears to prioritise maximising the distance to the predator and creates conflict in the effectiveness of predators’ attacks and the prey’s avoidance, explaining the empirically observed predators’ attack strategies and the fountain evasions produced by prey. Overall, we identify the proximate and ultimate explanations for fountain effects and more generally highlight that the collective patterns of self-organised predatory-prey systems can be understood by considering both social escape rules and attack strategies.},

            Movement is essential in the ecology of most animals, and it typically consumes a large proportion of individual energy budgets. Environmental conditions modulate the energetic cost of movement (cost of transport, {COT}), and there are pronounced differences in {COT} between individuals within species and across species. Differences in morphology affect {COT}, but the physiological mechanisms underlying variation in {COT} remain unresolved. Candidates include mitochondrial efficiency and the efficiency of muscle contraction–relaxation dynamics. Animals can offset increased {COT} behaviourally by adjusting movement rate and habitat selection. Here, we review the theory underlying {COT} and the impact of environmental changes on {COT}. Increasing temperatures, in particular, increase {COT} and its variability between individuals. Thermal acclimation and exercise can affect {COT}, but this is not consistent across taxa. Anthropogenic pollutants can increase {COT}, although few chemical pollutants have been investigated. Ecologically, {COT} may modify the allocation of energy to different fitness-related functions, and thereby influence fitness of individuals, and the dynamics of animal groups and communities. Future research should consider the effects of multiple stressors on {COT}, including a broader range of pollutants, the underlying mechanisms of {COT} and experimental quantifications of potential {COT}-induced allocation trade-offs.},

            Predator–prey interactions are critical to the biology of a diversity of animals. Although prey capture is determined by the direction, velocity, and timing of motion by both animals, it is generally unclear what strategies are employed by predators and prey to guide locomotion. Here we review our research on fishes that tests the pursuit strategy of predators and the evasion strategy of prey through kinematic measurements and agent-based models. This work demonstrates that fish predators track prey with variations on a deviated-pursuit strategy that is guided by visual cues. Fish prey employ a mixed strategy that varies with factors such as the direction of a predator’s approach. Our models consider the stochastic nature of interactions by incorporating measured probability distributions to accurately predict measurements of survivorship. A sensitivity analysis of these models shows the importance of the response distance of prey to their survival. Collectively, this work demonstrates how strategy affects the outcome of predator–prey interactions and articulates the roles of sensing, control, and propulsion.

              Temperature imposes significant constraints on ectothermic animals, and these organisms have evolved numerous adaptations to respond to these constraints. While the impacts of temperature on the physiology of ectotherms have been extensively studied, there are currently no frameworks available that outline the multiple and often simultaneous pathways by which temperature can affect behaviour. Drawing from the literature on insects, we propose a unified framework that should apply to all ectothermic animals, generalizing temperature's behavioural effects into: (1) kinetic effects, resulting from temperature's bottom‐up constraining influence on metabolism and neurophysiology over a range of timescales (from short to long term), and (2) integrated effects, where the top‐down integration of thermal information intentionally initiates or modifies a behaviour (behavioural thermoregulation, thermal orientation, thermosensory behavioural adjustments). We discuss the difficulty in distinguishing adaptive behavioural changes from constraints when observing animals' behavioural responses to temperature. We then propose two complementary approaches to distinguish adaptations from constraints, and categorize behaviours according to our framework: (
              i
              ) ‘kinetic null modelling’ of temperature's effects on behaviour; and (
              ii
              ) behavioural ecology experiments using temperature‐insensitive mutants. Our framework should help to guide future research on the complex relationship between temperature and behaviour in ectothermic animals.},

For example, training {GPT}-3 in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More critically, the global {AI} demand may be accountable for 4.2 -- 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 -- 6 Denmark or half of the United Kingdom. This is very concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, {AI} models can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water footprint of {AI} models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of {AI} models' runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable {AI}.},

              Migratory ungulates are thought to be declining globally because their dependence on large landscapes renders them highly vulnerable to environmental change. Yet recent studies reveal that many ungulate species can adjust their migration propensity in response to changing environmental conditions to potentially improve population persistence. In addition to the question of
              whether
              to migrate, decisions of
              where
              and
              when
              to migrate appear equally fundamental to individual migration tactics, but these three dimensions of plasticity have rarely been explored together. Here, we expand the concept of migratory plasticity beyond individual switches in migration propensity to also include spatial and temporal adjustments to migration patterns. We develop a novel typological framework that delineates every potential change type within the three dimensions, then use this framework to guide a literature review. We discuss broad patterns in migratory plasticity, potential drivers of migration change, and research gaps in the current understanding of this trait. Our result reveals 127 migration change events in direct response to natural and human‐induced environmental changes across 27 ungulate species. Species that appeared in multiple studies showed multiple types of change, with some exhibiting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity. This result highlights that multidimensional migratory plasticity is pervasive in ungulates, even as the manifestation of plasticity varies case by case. However, studies thus far have rarely been able to determine the fitness outcomes of different types of migration change, likely due to the scarcity of long‐term individual‐based demographic monitoring as well as measurements encompassing a full behavioral continuum and environmental gradient for any given species. Recognizing and documenting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity marks the first step for the field of migration ecology to employ quantitative methods, such as reaction norms, to predict migration change along environmental gradients. Closer monitoring for changes in migratory propensity, routes, and timing may improve the efficacy of conservation strategies and management actions in a rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {As habitat loss and fragmentation increase across ungulate ranges, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on new urgency. Here we present a general framework using the Brownian bridge movement model ({BBMM}) that: (1) provides a probabilistic estimate of the migration routes of a sampled population, (2) distinguishes between route segments that function as stopover sites vs. those used primarily as movement corridors, and (3) prioritizes routes for conservation based upon the proportion of the sampled population that uses them. We applied this approach to a migratory mule deer (
              Odocoileus hemionus
              ) population in a pristine area of southwest Wyoming, {USA}, where 2000 gas wells and 1609 km of pipelines and roads have been proposed for development. Our analysis clearly delineated where migration routes occurred relative to proposed development and provided guidance for on‐the‐ground conservation efforts. Mule deer migration routes were characterized by a series of stopover sites where deer spent most of their time, connected by movement corridors through which deer moved quickly. Our findings suggest management strategies that differentiate between stopover sites and movement corridors may be warranted. Because some migration routes were used by more mule deer than others, proportional level of use may provide a reasonable metric by which routes can be prioritized for conservation. The methods we outline should be applicable to a wide range of species that inhabit regions where migration routes are threatened or poorly understood.},

                    The migratory movements of wild animals can promote abundance and support ecosystem functioning. For large herbivores, mounting evidence suggests that migratory behaviour is an individually variable trait, where individuals can easily switch between migrant and resident tactics. The degree of migratory plasticity, including
                    whether
                    and
                    where
                    to migrate, has important implications for the ecology and conservation of large herbivores in a changing world.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Mule deer (
                    Odocoileus hemionus
                    ) are an iconic species of western North America, but are notably absent from the body of literature that suggests large herbivore migrations are highly plastic. We evaluated plasticity of migration in female mule deer using longitudinal
                    {GPS}
                    data collected from 312 individuals across nine populations in the western United States, including 882 animal‐years (801 migrants and 81 residents).
                  
                
                
                  
                    We followed both resident and migratory mule deer through time to determine whether individual animals switched migratory behaviours (i.e.,
                    whether
                    to migrate) from migratory to residency or vice versa. Additionally, we examined the fidelity of individuals to their migration routes (i.e.,
                    where
                    to migrate) to determine whether they used the same routes year after year. We also evaluated whether age and reproductive status affected propensity to migrate or fidelity to migratory routes.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Our results indicate that mule deer, unlike other large herbivores, have little or no plasticity in terms of
                    whether
                    or
                    where
                    they migrate. Resident deer remained residents, and migrant deer remained migrants, regardless of age, reproductive status or number of years monitored. Further, migratory individuals showed strong fidelity ({\textgreater}80\%) to their migration routes year after year.
                  
                
                
                  Our study clearly shows that migration plasticity is not ubiquitous among large herbivores. Because of their rigid migratory behaviour, mule deer may not adapt to changing environmental conditions as readily as large herbivores with more plastic migratory behaviour (e.g., elk). The fixed migratory behaviours of mule deer make clear that conservation efforts aimed at traditional seasonal ranges and migration routes are warranted for sustaining this iconic species that continues to decline across its range.},

            The recent intensification of floods and droughts in the Fraser River Basin ({FRB}) of British Columbia has had profound cultural, ecological, and economic impacts that are expected to be exacerbated further by anthropogenic climate change. In part due to short instrumental runoff records, the long-term stationarity of hydroclimatic extremes in this major North American watershed remains poorly understood, highlighting the need to use high-resolution paleoenvironmental proxies to inform on past streamflow. Here we use a network of tree-ring proxy records to develop 11 subbasin-scale, complementary flood- and drought-season reconstructions, the first of their kind. The reconstructions explicitly target management-relevant flood and drought seasons within each basin, and are examined in tandem to provide an expanded assessment of extreme events across the {FRB} with immediate implications for water management. We find that past high flood-season flows have been of greater magnitude and occurred in more consecutive years than during the observational record alone. Early 20th century low flows in the drought season were especially severe in both duration and magnitude in some subbasins relative to recent dry periods. Our Fraser subbasin-scale reconstructions provide long-term benchmarks for the natural flood and drought variability prior to anthropogenic forcing. These reconstructions demonstrate that the instrumental streamflow records upon which current management is based likely underestimate the full natural magnitude, duration, and frequency of extreme seasonal flows in the {FRB}, as well as the potential severity of future anthropogenically forced events.},

            The diversity in organismal responses to environmental changes (i.e., response diversity) plays a crucial role in shaping community and ecosystem stability. However, existing measures of response diversity only consider a single environmental variable, whereas natural communities are commonly exposed to changes in multiple environmental variables simultaneously. Thus far, no approach exists to integrate multifarious environmental change and the measurement of response diversity. Here, we show how to consider and quantify response diversity in the context of multifarious environmental change, and in doing so introduce a distinction between response diversity to a defined or anticipated environmental change, and the response capacity to any possible set of (defined or undefined) future environmental changes. First, we describe and illustrate the concepts with empirical data. We reveal the role of the trajectory of environmental change in shaping response diversity when multiple environmental variables fluctuate over time. We show that, when the trajectory of the environmental change is undefined (i.e., there is no information or a priori expectation about how an environmental condition will change in future), we can quantify the response capacity of a community to any possible environmental change scenario. That is, we can estimate the capacity of a system to respond under a range of realistic or extreme environmental changes, with utility for predicting future responses to even multifarious environmental change. Finally, we investigate determinants of response diversity within a multifarious environmental change context. We identify factors such as the diversity of species responses to each environmental variable, the relative influence of different environmental variables and temporal means of environmental variable values as important determinants of response diversity. In doing so, we take an important step towards measuring and understanding the insurance capacity of ecological communities exposed to multifarious environmental change.

            Sommario
            La diversità con cui gli organismi rispondono ai cambiamenti ambientali (ovvero la diversità di risposta) svolge un ruolo cruciale nel determinare la stabilità delle comunità ecologiche e degli ecosistemi. Tuttavia i metodi esistenti per quantificare la diversità di risposta considerano solo una singola variabile ambientale, mentre le comunità naturali sono normalmente esposte a fluttuazioni di più variabili ambientali contemporaneamente. Al momento non esiste un approccio per quantificare la diversità di risposta quando più variabili ambientali fluttuano contemporaneamente. In questo articolo spieghiamo come quantificare la diversità di risposta considerando diverse variabili ambientali. In questo modo introduciamo una distinzione tra la diversità di risposta a un cambiamento ambientale definito o previsto e la capacità di risposta a qualsiasi possibile insieme di cambiamenti ambientali futuri (definiti o non definiti). Per prima cosa descriviamo e illustriamo i concetti con dati empirici. Sottolineiamo il ruolo della traiettoria del cambiamento ambientale nel plasmare la diversità di risposta quando più variabili ambientali fluttuano nel tempo. Mostriamo che, quando la traiettoria del cambiamento ambientale è indefinita (cioè, non ci sono informazioni o previsioni a priori su come le variabili ambientali cambieranno in futuro), possiamo quantificare la capacità di risposta di una comunità a qualsiasi possibile scenario di cambiamento ambientale. In altre parole, possiamo stimare la capacità di un sistema di rispondere a una serie di cambiamenti ambientali realistici o estremi, con la finalità di prevedere le risposte future a cambiamenti ambientali, anche stocastici. Infine, analizziamo i fattori che determinano la diversità di risposta quando più variabili ambientali cambiano nel tempo. Identifichiamo fattori come la diversità delle risposte delle specie a ciascuna variabili ambientali, l'importanza relativa di diverse variabili ambientali nel determinare le risposte delle specie, e la media delle variabili ambientali come importanti fattori che determinano la diversità delle risposte. Con questo studio compiamo un passo importante verso la quantificazione e la comprensione della capacità delle comunità ecologiche di mantenere la loro stabilità anche quando esposte a molteplici cambiamenti ambientali.},

              Aim
              For many applications in biodiversity and ecology, existing remote sensing‐derived land‐cover products have limitations due to among‐product inconsistency and their typically non‐continuous nature. Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1‐km resolution global product that provides scale‐integrated and accuracy‐weighted consensus land‐cover information on an approximately continuous scale.
            
            
              Location
              Global.
            
            
              Methods
              Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy‐based integration approach, we integrated four global land‐cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30‐m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists.
            
            
              Results
              
                Our product offers accuracy‐weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land‐cover classes within every nominal 1‐km pixel across the globe (except for
                A
                ntarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land‐cover information contained in the fine‐grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine‐grain land‐cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions.
              
            
            
              Main conclusions
              Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land‐cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land‐cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.},

            During the past century, the fundamental niche, the complete set of environments that allow an individual, population, or species to persist, has shaped ecological thinking. It is a crucial concept connecting population dynamics, spatial ecology, and evolutionary theory, and a prerequisite for predictive ecological models at a time of rapid environmental change. Yet, its properties have eluded quantification, particularly for mobile, cognitively complex organisms. These difficulties are mainly a result of the separation between niche theory and field data, and the dichotomy between environmental and geographical spaces. Here, I combine recent mathematical and statistical results linking habitats to population growth, to achieve a quantitative and intuitive understanding of the fundamental niches of animals. I trace the development of niche ideas from the early steps of ecology to their use in modern statistical and conservation practice. I examine how animal mobility and behavior may blur the division between geographical and environmental space. I discuss how the central models of population and spatial ecology lead to a concise mathematical equation for the fundamental niche of animals and demonstrate how fitness parameters can be understood and directly estimated by fitting this model simultaneously to data on population growth and spatial distributions. I first illustrate these concepts theoretically for territorial species. I then fit the fundamental niche model to a data set of house sparrow colonies to quantify how a species of selective animals can increase their fitness in heterogeneous environments. This work confirms ideas that had been anticipated in the historical niche literature. Specifically, within traditionally defined environmental spaces, habitat heterogeneity and behavioral plasticity make the fundamental niche more complex and malleable than was historically envisaged. However, once examined in higher‐dimensional environmental spaces, accounting for spatial heterogeneity, the niche is more predictable than recently suspected. This re‐evaluation quantifies how organisms might buffer themselves from change by bending the boundaries of viable environmental space and offers a framework for designing optimal habitat interventions to protect biodiversity or obstruct invasive species. It therefore promotes the fundamental niche as a key concept for understanding animal responses to changing environments and a central tool for environmental management.},

This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in this paper.},

                    Kernel density estimators are widely applied to area‐related problems in ecology, from estimating the home range of an individual to estimating the geographic range of a species. Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals.
                  
                  
                    We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data.
                  
                  
                    The area‐corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives.
                  
                  
                    
                      This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home‐range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the

              Many ecosystems contain sympatric predator species that hunt in different places and times. We tested whether this provides vacant hunting domains, places and times where and when predators are least active, that prey use to minimize threats from multiple predators simultaneously. We measured how northern Yellowstone elk (
              Cervus elaphus
              ) responded to wolves (
              Canis lupus

              Puma concolor
              ), and found that elk selected for areas outside the high‐risk domains of both predators consistent with the vacant domain hypothesis. This enabled elk to avoid one predator without necessarily increasing its exposure to the other. Our results demonstrate how the diel cycle can serve as a key axis of the predator hunting domain that prey exploit to manage predation risk from multiple sources. We argue that a multi‐predator, spatiotemporal framework is vital to understand the causes and consequences of prey spatial response to predation risk in environments with more than one predator.},

We developed a robust classification for accelerometer data and measured multiple dimensions of sleep in the wild boar (
              Sus scrofa
              ) over an annual cycle. In support of the hypothesis that environmental conditions determine thermoregulatory challenges, which regulate sleep, we show that sleep quantity, efficiency and quality are reduced on warmer days, sleep is less fragmented in longer and more humid days, while greater snow cover and rainfall promote sleep quality. Importantly, this longest and most detailed analysis of sleep in wild animals to date reveals large inter- and intra-individual variation. Specifically, short-sleepers sleep up to 46\% less than long-sleepers but do not compensate for their short sleep through greater plasticity or quality, suggesting they may pay higher costs of sleep deprivation. Given the major role of sleep in health, our results suggest that global warming and the associated increase in extreme climatic events are likely to negatively impact sleep, and consequently health, in wildlife, particularly in nocturnal animals.},

	abstract = {Climatic shifts to warmer and often drier conditions are challenging terrestrial species worldwide. These shifts are occurring more rapidly at higher elevations and latitudes, likely causing disproportionate effects to mammalian hibernators there. While there is some information about how these species' ranges are responding to climatic shifts, we lack an understanding of how climate components are affecting species' life history variation, which is key to individual success and population‐level resilience. We reviewed the literature to identify the direction of life history responses to climate change in mammalian hibernators along three axes: latitudinal, elevational and temporal. We found 39 studies involving 27 species that reported climate effects on our four target life history traits – phenology, body mass/condition and growth, reproduction and survival. We found warmer temperatures are advancing hibernator phenology and increasing reproductive success. By contrast, warming and drying trends are having uncertain effects on body condition, and complex effects on survival – depending on season, age class, latitude and elevation. We found no pattern of significant climate‐trait outcomes by duration or decade of study. More research on drought conditions – particularly in relation to resource availability – would help inform hibernator susceptibility to increased drying trends expected to intensify globally. Notably, our results are highly biased towards small mammal hibernators in Northern Hemisphere alpine/mountain ecosystems, with few long‐term studies conducted on Southern Hemisphere hibernators. This review highlights that phenological shifts constitute one of the most obvious consequences of climate change, yet, the timing of life history events (e.g. timing of migration, reproduction, hibernation) remains poorly understood. Further integration of insights from physiologists, evolutionary biologists and population ecologists working on wild populations will improve our collective understanding of the effects of seasonal climatic shifts on mammalian hibernator life history traits, key drivers of their population‐level persistence.},

                  Expanding human development and climate change are dramatically altering habitat conditions for wildlife. While the initial response of wildlife to changing environmental conditions is typically a shift in behaviour, little is known about the effects of these stressors on hibernation behaviour, an important life‐history trait that can subsequently affect animal physiology, demography, interspecific interactions and human‐wildlife interactions. Given future trajectories of land use and climate change, it is important that wildlife professionals understand how animals that hibernate are adapting to altered landscape conditions so that management activities can be appropriately tailored.
                
                
                  
                    We investigated the influence of human development and weather on hibernation in black bears (
                    Ursus americanus
                    ), a species of high management concern, whose behaviour is strongly tied to natural food availability, anthropogenic foods around development and variation in annual weather conditions. Using
                    {GPS}
                    collar data from 131 den events of adult female bears (
                    n
                     = 51), we employed fine‐scale, animal‐specific habitat information to evaluate the relative and cumulative influence of natural food availability, anthropogenic food and weather on the start, duration and end of hibernation.
                  
                
                
                  We found that weather and food availability (both natural and human) additively shaped black bear hibernation behaviour. Of the habitat variables we examined, warmer temperatures were most strongly associated with denning chronology, reducing the duration of hibernation and expediting emergence in the spring. Bears appeared to respond to natural and anthropogenic foods similarly, as more natural foods, and greater use of human foods around development, both postponed hibernation in the fall and decreased its duration.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    . Warmer temperatures and use of anthropogenic food subsides additively reduced black bear hibernation, suggesting that future changes in climate and land use may further alter bear behaviour and increase the length of their active season. We speculate that longer active periods for bears will result in subsequent increases in human–bear conflicts and human‐caused bear mortalities. These metrics are commonly used by wildlife agencies to index trends in bear populations, but have the potential to be misleading when bear behaviour dynamically adapts to changing environmental conditions, and should be substituted with reliable demographic methods.

            During summer 2021, Western North America ({WNA}) experienced an unprecedented heatwave with record-breaking high temperatures associated with a strong anomalous high-pressure system, i.e., a heat dome. Here, we use a flow analog method and find that the heat dome over the {WNA} can explain half of the magnitude of the anomalous temperature. The intensities of hot extremes associated with similar heat dome-like atmospheric circulations increase faster than background global warming in both historical change and future projection. Such relationship between hot extremes and mean temperature can be partly explained by soil moisture-atmosphere feedback. The probability of 2021-like heat extremes is projected to increase due to the background warming, the enhanced soil moisture-atmosphere feedback and the weak but still significantly increased probability of the heat dome-like circulation. The population exposure to such heat extremes will also increase. Limiting global warming to 1.5 °C instead of 2 °C (3 °C) would lead to an avoided impact of 53\% (89\%) of the increase in population exposure to 2021-like heat extremes under the {RCP}8.5-{SSP}5 scenario.},

            Seasonal snow is among the most important factors governing the ecology of many terrestrial ecosystems, but rising global temperatures are changing snow regimes and driving widespread declines in the depth and duration of snow cover. Loss of the insulating snow layer will fundamentally change the environment. Understanding how individuals, populations, and communities respond to different snow conditions is thus essential for predicting and managing future ecosystem change. We synthesized 365 studies that examined ecological responses to variation in winter snow conditions. This research encompasses a broad range of methods (experimental manipulations, measurement of natural snow gradients, and long‐term monitoring), locations (35 countries), study organisms (plants, mammals, arthropods, birds, fish, lichen, and fungi), and response measures. Earlier snowmelt was consistently associated with advanced spring phenology in plants, mammals, and arthropods. Reduced snow depth often increased mortality or physical injury in plants, although there were few clear effects on animals. Neither snow depth nor snowmelt timing had clear or consistent directional effects on body size of animals or biomass of plants. However, because 96\% of studies were from the northern hemisphere, the generality of these trends across ecosystems and localities is also unclear. We identified substantial research gaps for several taxonomic groups and response types; research on wintertime responses was notably scarce. Future research should prioritize examination of the mechanisms underlying responses to changing snow conditions and the consequences of those responses for seasonally snow‐covered ecosystems.

              Respuestas Ecológicas a la Variación de la Cobertura Estacional de Nieve
              
                Resumen
                La nieve estacional se encuentra entre los factores más importantes que determinan la ecología de muchos ecosistemas terrestres, pero las crecientes temperaturas mundiales están cambiando los sistemas de nieve y causando declinaciones generalizadas en la profundidad y la duración de la capa de nieve. La pérdida de la capa de nieve aislante cambiará fundamentalmente el ambiente. El entendimiento de cómo los individuos, las poblaciones y las comunidades responden a las diferentes condiciones de nieve es esencial para predecir y manejar los cambios del ecosistema en el futuro. Sintetizamos 365 estudios que examinaron las respuestas ecológicas a la variación en las condiciones invernales de nieve. Esta investigación engloba una gama amplia de métodos (manipulaciones experimentales, medida de los gradientes naturales de nieve y monitoreo a largo plazo), localidades (35 países), organismos de estudio (plantas, mamíferos, artrópodos, aves, peces, líquenes y hongos) y medidas de respuesta. El deshielo temprano estuvo asociado continuamente con el adelanto de la fenología de plantas, mamíferos y artrópodos en primavera. La reducción de la profundidad de la nieve con frecuencia incrementó la mortalidad o las lesiones físicas en las plantas, aunque tuvo pocos efectos visibles sobre los animales. Ni la profundidad de la nieve ni la temporalidad del deshielo tuvieron efectos direccionales claros o consistentes sobre el tamaño corporal de los animales o la biomasa de las plantas. Sin embargo, ya que el 96\% de los estudios se realizó en el hemisferio norte, la generalidad de estas tendencias en todos los ecosistemas y localidades tampoco está clara. Identificamos vacíos importantes en la investigación en torno a varios grupos taxonómicos y los tipos de respuesta; la información sobre las respuestas invernales estaba particularmente reducida. Las futuras investigaciones deberían priorizar el análisis de los mecanismos subyacentes a las respuestas ante las condiciones cambiantes de nieve y las consecuencias de aquellas respuestas para los ecosistemas cubiertos de nieve.

	abstract = {Snowpack dynamics have a major influence on wildlife movement ecology and predator–prey interactions. Specific snow properties such as density, hardness, and depth determine how much an animal sinks into the snowpack, which in turn drives both the energetic cost of locomotion and predation risk. Here, we quantified the relationships between five field‐measured snow variables and snow track sink depths for widely distributed predators (bobcats
              Lynx rufus
              , cougars
              Puma concolor

              , and moose
              Alces alces
              ) in interior Alaska and northern Washington, {USA}. We first used generalized additive models to identify which snow metrics best predicted sink depths for each species and across all species. Next, we used breakpoint regression to identify thresholds of support for the best‐performing predictor of sink depth for each species (i.e. values wherein tracks do not sink appreciably deeper into the snow). Finally, we identified ‘danger zones,' wherein snow impedes the mobility of ungulates more than carnivores, by comparing sink depths relative to hind leg lengths among predator–prey pairs. Near‐surface (0–20 cm) snow density was the strongest predictor of sink depth across species. Thresholds of support occurred at near‐surface snow densities between 220–310 kg m
              –
              3
              for predators and 300–410 kg m
              –
              3
              for prey, and danger zones peaked at intermediate snow densities (200–300 kg m
              –
              3
              ) for eight of the ten predator–prey pairs. These results can be used to link predator–prey relationships with spatially explicit snow modeling outputs and projected future changes in snow density. As climate change rapidly reshapes snowpack dynamics, these danger zones provide a useful framework to anticipate likely winners and losers of future winter conditions.},

              Background
              Caribou and reindeer across the Arctic spend more than two thirds of their lives moving in snow. Yet snow-specific mechanisms driving their winter ecology and potentially influencing herd health and movement patterns are not well known. Integrative research coupling snow and wildlife sciences using observations, models, and wildlife tracking technologies can help fill this knowledge void.
            
            
              Methods
              Here, we quantified the effects of snow depth on caribou winter range selection and movement. We used location data of Central Arctic Herd ({CAH}) caribou in Arctic Alaska collected from 2014 to 2020 and spatially distributed and temporally evolving snow depth data produced by {SnowModel}. These landscape-scale (90 m), daily snow depth data reproduced the observed spatial snow-depth variability across typical areal extents occupied by a wintering caribou during a 24-h period.
            
            
              Results
              We found that fall snow depths encountered by the herd north of the Brooks Range exerted a strong influence on selection of two distinct winter range locations. In winters with relatively shallow fall snow depth (2016/17, 2018/19, and 2019/20), the majority of the {CAH} wintered on the tundra north of the Brooks Range mountains. In contrast, during the winters with relatively deep fall snow depth (2014/15, 2015/16, and 2017/18), the majority of the {CAH} caribou wintered in the mountainous boreal forest south of the Brooks Range. Long-term (19 winters; 2001–2020) monitoring of {CAH} caribou winter distributions confirmed this relationship. Additionally, snow depth affected movement and selection differently within these two habitats: in the mountainous boreal forest, caribou avoided areas with deeper snow, but when on the tundra, snow depth did not trigger significant deep-snow avoidance. In both wintering habitats, {CAH} caribou selected areas with higher lichen abundance, and they moved significantly slower when encountering deeper snow.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In general, our findings indicate that regional-scale selection of winter range is influenced by snow depth at or prior to fall migration. During winter, daily decision-making within the winter range is driven largely by snow depth. This integrative approach of coupling snow and wildlife observations with snow-evolution and caribou-movement modeling to quantify the multi-facetted effects of snow on wildlife ecology is applicable to caribou and reindeer herds throughout the Arctic.},

            While benchmark dose ({BMD}) methodology is well‐established for settings with a single exposure, these methods cannot easily handle multidimensional exposures with nonlinear effects. We propose a framework for {BMD} analysis to characterize the joint effect of a two‐dimensional exposure on a continuous outcome using a generalized additive model while adjusting for potential confounders via propensity scores. This leads to a dose–response surface which can be summarized in two dimensions by a contour plot in which combinations of exposures leading to the same expected effect are identified. In our motivating study of prenatal alcohol exposure, cognitive deficits in children are found to be associated with both the frequency of drinking as well as the amount of alcohol consumed on each drinking day during pregnancy. The general methodological framework is useful for a broad range of settings, including combinations of environmental stressors, such as chemical mixtures, and in explorations of the impact of dose rate rather than simply cumulative exposure on adverse outcomes.},

For endotherms, maintaining body temperature within safe bounds is fundamental for performance and survival. Animals routinely modify their behavior to buffer physiological impacts of high temperatures (eg ceasing activity, seeking shade). However, this can impose substantial costs related to missed opportunities to engage in other important activities, with potentially large but often overlooked consequences for survival and reproduction. Here, we outline behavioral trade‐offs birds and mammals face in navigating thermal landscapes and associated challenges of balancing energy, water, and time budgets; review the rapidly expanding knowledge in this field; and summarize examples – across taxa – of fitness costs during hot weather. We argue that a shift is needed in evaluating the impacts of heat on birds and mammals, and that fitness costs of missed opportunities must be explicitly integrated into climate‐change vulnerability frameworks.},

Under global warming, diurnally adapted endotherms may achieve a better energy balance by shifting their activity towards cooler nocturnal hours. However, this shift may expose animals to new or increased environmental challenges (e.g. increased predation risk, reduced foraging efficiency). We analysed a large dataset of activity data from 47 ibex (
              Capra ibex
              ) in two protected areas, characterized by varying levels of predation risk (presence versus absence of the wolf—

              ). We found that ibex increased nocturnal activity following warmer days and during brighter nights. Despite the considerable sexual dimorphism typical of this species and the consequent different predation-risk perception, males and females demonstrated consistent responses to heat in both predator-present and predator-absent areas. This supports the hypothesis that shifting activity towards nighttime may be a common strategy adopted by diurnal endotherms in response to global warming. As nowadays different pressures are pushing mammals towards nocturnality, our findings emphasize the urgent need to integrate knowledge of temporal behavioural modifications into management and conservation planning.},

This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph ({DAG}) approach to causal inference, integrating {DAGs} into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses},

Accurate predictions of spring reproductive (“flowering”) phenology are essential for understanding local adaptation, gene flow, population structure, and climate change impacts. Using 16 years of data from lodgepole pine sourced from across British Columbia and grown at seven seed orchard sites in an approximate common garden design, I developed a multilevel Bayesian model to assess the forcing requirements for flowering onset and cessation, and the provenance effects on these requirements for both male and female strobili. The model reveals a countergradient pattern in flowering: populations from warm locations require more forcing by warm temperatures than those from colder locations. This countergradient effect should result in increased overlap among populations at the landscape level but decreased overlap within individual seed orchards. Pollen shed typically begins shortly before and ends slightly after receptivity. By applying the model to historical and predicted daily temperature records, I estimated flowering phenology for diverse provenances at multiple sites from 1945 to 2100, translating forcing predictions into specific days of the year. Historical flowering patterns are variable but show significant correlations across distant sites. Under moderate climate change scenarios, flowering is predicted to advance by two to three weeks without having appreciable impacts on synchrony.},

              Long‐term ice phenology records quantify the effects of climate change on Northern Hemisphere lakes. This study uses lake ice phenological records across a gradient of lake sizes (0.1–31,967.8 km
              2
              in lake surface area) obtained from community science networks. We compiled in situ ice phenological records for 2,499 lakes across 15 countries for an average of 30 years. These data revealed that for the last 50 years (1971–2020), the annual mean duration of lake ice cover decreased at a rate of 9 days per decade, with a regime shift in lake ice phenology in the late 1980s. We projected that at the end of the century (2070–2099), ice duration will decrease by an average of 10 days when compared to the historical time period (1971–2000) for the shared socioeconomic pathway ({SSP}) 1–2.6 climate scenario ({SSP}126), 23 days for {SSP}370, and 28 days for the {SSP}585. Impending human development can enhance or attenuate lake ice loss, as adaptation strategies can accelerate fossil fuel use, result in conflict, or seek strategies apart from fossil fuel development. These future pathways have critical implications for the future preservation of lake ice cover.

              Predicting the geographic range of species and their response to climatic variation and change are entwined goals in conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models ({SDMs}) are foundational in this effort and used to visualize the geographic range of species as the spatial representation of its realized niche. {SDMs} are also used to forecast range shifts under climate change, but often in the absence of empirical evidence that climate limits population growth. We explored the influence of climate on demography, seasonal migration, and the extent of the geographic range in song sparrows (
              Melospiza melodia
              ), a species thought to display marked local adaptation to regional climate. To do so, we developed {SDMs} to predict the demographic and climate niches of migratory and resident song sparrows across our study area in western North America from California to Alaska, using 48 years of demographic data from a focal population in British Columbia and 1.2 million continental‐scale citizen science observations. Spatial agreement of our demographic and climate niche models in the region of our focal population was strong (76\%), supporting the hypothesis that demographic performance and the occurrence of seasonal migration varied predictably with climatic conditions. In contrast, agreement at the northern (58\%) and southern (40\%) extents of our study area was lower, as expected if the factors limiting population growth vary regionally. Our results support the hypothesis that local climate drives spatial variation in the occurrence of seasonal migration in song sparrows by limiting the fitness of year‐round residents, and suggest that climate warming has favored range expansions and facilitated an upward shift in elevational range song sparrows that forgo seasonal migration. Our work highlights the potential role of seasonal migration in climate adaptation and limits on the reliability of climate niche models not validated with demographic data.},

	abstract = {Environmental change poses a significant threat to landscape connectivity and threatened wildlife populations. There is a growing need to understand the impacts of broad-scale change across dynamic landscapes on wildlife movement to inform conservation strategies and landscape management plans. As the availability of satellite imagery time series increases, there are new opportunities to monitor broad-scale changes in ecosystems and landscape connectivity. The objective of this thesis is to apply novel methodological approaches using a time series of Landsat imagery to quantify spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem cover and landscape connectivity from 1997 to 2019 in west-central British Columbia, Canada. Using Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping ({TWDTW}) and Landsat imagery, spatiotemporal changes in biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification ({BEC}) zones were quantified to summarize complex patterns of change that reflect the influence of landscape disturbance. The {TWDTW} classification showed a transition of the {IDF} Dry ecosystem to {MS} Dry and {SPBS} Dry in the north and northeast of the study area in response to large wildfires in the region. Reduced {IDF} Dry cover signifies a loss in ungulate habitat, variation in the “green-up” date of vegetation, and increased low productivity forest cover. Omniscape, a circuit theory approach for omni-directional landscape connectivity modelling, was then used to quantify and map landscape connectivity for moose (Alces alces) populations in 1997, 2009, and 2019 and assess the impacts of ecosystem change on potential wildlife movement. Overall landscape connectivity for moose reduced by 70.23\% between 1997 and 2019, during which time broad-scale disturbance resulted in ecosystem change. Results represent a novel spatiotemporal analysis of landscape connectivity, reveal variation in overall connectivity for moose across the region in response to disturbance, and predict the location of potential movement corridors. In summary, this thesis demonstrates the application of the {TWDTW} approach to classify spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem cover across heterogeneous landscapes and the suitability of the Omniscape method for quantifying changing patterns of potential landscape connectivity in the context of ongoing ecosystem change. The combination of time series ecosystem change monitoring and connectivity modelling provides the opportunity to examine the important spatiotemporal relationship between ecosystem cover, disturbance, and wildlife movement.},

            Environmental variation is becoming more frequent and unpredictable as a consequence of climate change, yet we currently lack the tools to evaluate the extent to which organisms may adapt to this phenomenon. Here we develop a model that explores these issues and use it to study how changes in the timescale and predictability of environmental variation may ultimately affect population viability. Our model indicates that, although populations can often cope with fairly large changes in these environmental parameters, on occasion they will collapse abruptly and go extinct. We characterize the conditions under which these evolutionary tipping points occur and discuss how vulnerability to such cryptic threats may depend on the genetic architecture and life history of the organisms involved.
          , 
            In an era of rapid climate change, there is a pressing need to understand how organisms will cope with faster and less predictable variation in environmental conditions. Here we develop a unifying model that predicts evolutionary responses to environmentally driven fluctuating selection and use this theoretical framework to explore the potential consequences of altered environmental cycles. We first show that the parameter space determined by different combinations of predictability and timescale of environmental variation is partitioned into distinct regions where a single mode of response (reversible phenotypic plasticity, irreversible phenotypic plasticity, bet-hedging, or adaptive tracking) has a clear selective advantage over all others. We then demonstrate that, although significant environmental changes within these regions can be accommodated by evolution, most changes that involve transitions between regions result in rapid population collapse and often extinction. Thus, the boundaries between response mode regions in our model correspond to evolutionary tipping points, where even minor changes in environmental parameters can have dramatic and disproportionate consequences on population viability. Finally, we discuss how different life histories and genetic architectures may influence the location of tipping points in parameter space and the likelihood of extinction during such transitions. These insights can help identify and address some of the cryptic threats to natural populations that are likely to result from any natural or human-induced change in environmental conditions. They also demonstrate the potential value of evolutionary thinking in the study of global climate change.},

              Although it is well established that density dependence drives changes in organismal abundance over time, relatively little is known about how density dependence affects variation in abundance over space. We tested the hypothesis that spatial trade‐offs between food and safety can change the drivers of population distribution, caused by opposing patterns of density‐dependent habitat selection ({DDHS}) that are predicted by the multidimensional ideal free distribution. We addressed this using winter aerial survey data of northern Yellowstone elk (
              Cervus canadensis
              ) spanning four decades. Supporting our hypothesis, we found positive {DDHS} for food (herbaceous biomass) and negative {DDHS} for safety (openness and roughness), such that the primary driver of habitat selection switched from food to safety as elk density decreased from 9.3 to 2.0 elk/km
              2
              . Our results demonstrate how population density can drive landscape‐level shifts in population distribution, confounding habitat selection inference and prediction and potentially affecting community‐level interactions.},

            The interactions of basal rate of metabolism, thermal conductance, body temperature, lower limit of thermoneutrality, and body weight in mammals are compatible with Newton’s law of cooling. A small body weight will normally reduce the level and preciseness of body temperature, but a high basal rate of metabolism or a low thermal conductance may compensate for a small size and permit a high, precise temperature to be maintained. The parameters of energetics that fix the level and preciseness of body temperature in mammals are ultimately correlated in turn with the environmental parameters of climate and food habits. Birds generally have higher temperatures than mammals because the basal rates of metabolism are higher and the conductances lower in birds than in mammals of the same weight.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              From megafauna to amoebas, the amount of space heterotrophic organisms use is thought to be tightly linked to the availability of resources within their habitats, such that organisms living in productive habitats generally require less space than those in resource-poor habitats. This hypothesis has widespread empirical support, but existing studies have focused primarily on responses to spatiotemporal changes in mean resources, while responses to unpredictable changes in resources (i.e., variance in resources or resource stochasticity) are still largely unknown. Since organisms adjust to variable environmental conditions, failing to consider the effects of resource unpredictability can result in an insufficient understanding of an organism’s range size.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We leverage the available literature to provide a unifying framework and hypothesis for the effects of resource abundance and stochasticity on organisms’ range sizes. We then use simulated movement data to demonstrate how the combined effects of resource abundance and stochasticity interact to shape predictable patterns in range size. Finally, we test the hypothesis using real-world tracking data on a lowland tapir (
                Tapirus terrestris
                ) from the Brazilian Cerrado.
              
            
            
              Results
              Organisms’ range sizes decrease nonlinearly with resource abundance and increase nonlinearly with resource stochasticity, and the effects of resource stochasticity depend strongly on resource abundance. Additionally, the distribution and predictability of resources can exacerbate the effects of other drivers of movement, such as resource depletion, competition, and predation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Accounting for resource abundance and stochasticity is crucial for understanding the movement behavior of free-ranging organisms. Failing to account for resource stochasticity can lead to an incomplete and incorrect understanding of how and why organisms move, particularly during periods of rapid change.},

                  Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized.
                
                
                  
                    Discrete‐time correlated random walk models (
                    {CRW}
                    ) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately,
                    {CRW}
                    s confound the sampling and movement processes.
                    {CRW}
                    parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling‐independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore,
                    {CRW}
                    s cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous‐time stochastic process (
                    {CTSP}
                    ) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using
                    {CTSP}
                    s has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the
                    ctmm
                    package for the R statistical computing environment.
                    ctmm
                    implements all of the
                    {CTSP}
                    s currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non‐Markovian maximum likelihood estimation.
                  
                
                
                  
                    ctmm
                    is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and
                    {AIC}
                    ‐based model selection. Once an accurate
                    {CTSP}
                    for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time‐series Kriging, can then be performed.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of

                  Successful animal tracking projects depend on well-informed sampling strategies and robust methods to yield biologically meaningful inferences. Considering financial and logistical constraints, the reliability of research outputs is shaped by key decisions regarding study duration (
                  how long
                  should each individual be tracked?), sampling frequency (
                  how often
                  should new locations be collected?), and
                  how many
                  individuals should be tracked. To maximize their conservation value, studies must avoid biased estimates of key parameters related to movement behavior and space use, as this can lead to wasted resources and misguided management actions.
                
              
              
                
                  To address these challenges, we propose a workflow for determining the optimal sample sizes for population-level inferences in movement ecology, explicitly addressing the trade-offs between sampling duration (
                  T
                  ), sampling interval (reciprocal of frequency; Δ
                  t
                  ), and
                  population
                  sample size (
                  m
                  ). While
                  a priori
                  study design is considered best practice, this workflow can be applied at multiple stages, including concurrent with data collection, or as a
                  post hoc
                  evaluation.
                
              
              
                By selecting robust methods that are sampling-insensitive, and by quantifying and propagating uncertainty through downstream analyses, we can determine whether our sample sizes (both at the individual- and population-level) are sufficient to yield robust population-level inferences, such as mean home range area or mean movement speed. Furthermore, researchers can integrate additional logistical constraints such as fix success rate, location error, and potential device malfunctions, while also accounting for individual variation. We illustrate potential applications of this workflow through empirically-guided simulations.
              
              
                
                  To facilitate its use and implementation, we incorporated this workflow into the user-friendly
                  ‘movedesign’ R
                  Shiny application. This application enables researchers to easily test different sampling strategies, and as of version
                  0.3.2
                  , integrates population-level analytical targets. This workflow has the potential to improve the rigor and reliability of animal tracking projects conducted under logistical and financial constraints, and thereby support more effective scientific research, wildlife management, and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss and widespread ecosystem degradation are among the most pressing challenges of our time, requiring urgent action. Yet our understanding of their causes remains limited because prevailing ecological concepts and approaches often overlook the underlying complex interactions of individuals of the same or different species, interacting with each other and with their environment. We propose a paradigm shift in ecological science, moving from simplifying frameworks that use species, population or community averages to an integrative approach that recognizes individual organisms as fundamental agents of ecological change. The urgency of the biodiversity crisis requires such a paradigm shift to advance ecology towards a predictive science by elucidating the causal mechanisms linking individual variation and adaptive behaviour to emergent properties of populations, communities, ecosystems, and ecological interactions with human interventions. Recent advances in computational technologies, sensors, and analytical tools now offer unprecedented opportunities to overcome past challenges and lay the foundation for a truly integrated Individual-Based Global Change Ecology ({IBGCE}). Unravelling the potential role of individual variability in global change impact analyses will require a systematic combination of empirical, experimental and modelling studies across systems, while taking into account multiple drivers of global change and their interactions. Key priorities include refining theoretical frameworks, developing benchmark models and standardized toolsets, and systematically incorporating individual variation and adaptive behaviour into empirical field work, experiments and predictive models. The emerging synergies between individual-based modelling, big data approaches, and machine learning hold great promise for addressing the inherent complexity of ecosystems. Each step in the development of {IBGCE} must systematically balance the complexity of the individual perspective with parsimony, computational efficiency, and experimental feasibility. {IBGCE} aims to unravel and predict the dynamics of biodiversity in the Anthropocene through a comprehensive study of individual organisms, their variability and their interactions. It will provide a critical foundation for considering individual variation and behaviour for future conservation and sustainability management, taking into account individual-to-ecosystem pathways and feedbacks.},

We examined species-specific changes in phenology and assessed ecological traits for explaining interspecific variation. Additionally, we investigated the associations between phenological shifts and timing of snowmelt and temperature. We found consistent trends of earlier flight activity and interspecific variation in responses, with smaller species shifting their end-of-the-season activity at faster rates than larger species. Flight activity was strongly associated with the timing of snowmelt, while warming was linked to an earlier end-of-the-season activity. Late-active species exhibited more pronounced shifts in response to climate variations than early-active species. This study highlights that the species-specific climate sensitivity of high-Arctic muscid flies potentially has demographic effects if temporal overlap among interacting species changes. We advocate for prioritizing species-specific insect population studies, ideally analysed within the context of interacting species, to understand better and address disparities in responses to climate change.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} Green Wave Hypothesis posits that herbivore migration manifests in response to waves of spring green‐up (i.e. green‐wave surfing). Nonetheless, empirical support for the Green Wave Hypothesis is mixed, and a framework for understanding variation in surfing is lacking. In a population of migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), 31\% surfed plant phenology in spring as well as a theoretically perfect surfer, and 98\% surfed better than random. Green‐wave surfing varied among individuals and was unrelated to age or energetic state. Instead, the greenscape, which we define as the order, rate and duration of green‐up along migratory routes, was the primary factor influencing surfing. Our results indicate that migratory routes are more than a link between seasonal ranges, and they provide an important, but often overlooked, foraging habitat. In addition, the spatiotemporal configuration of forage resources that propagate along migratory routes shape animal movement and presumably, energy gains during migration.},

                  Between 1950 and 2010, winter temperatures in Alberta rose by 3.5°C to 5°C in the south and up to 7°C in the north, while summer temperatures increased by less than 1°C in most of the province.
                
                
                  The number of days with minimum temperatures below −20°C has generally about halved across Alberta, while the number of heat waves has roughly doubled.
                
                
                  Highest confidence levels were evident for rising trends in mean annual and winter temperatures, and declining trends in the number of days below −20°C and heating degree days.

              When a Canada‐wide daily climate time series, covering the period 1950–2010, became available, an opportunity arose to analyze the time series for trends of a variety of temperature indices. The 6,833 climate grid cells covering Alberta, each with an area of 10 km by 10 km, allowed the detailed mapping of 30 temperature indices across the province. From each time series, an annual series was computed, which then enabled trend analyses using the non‐parametric Mann‐Kendall and Sen Slope tests. New maps could be created at an unprecedented spatial resolution, and an associated website was developed to access all trends and changes between 1950 and 2010 for all grid cells at
              albertaclimaterecords.com
              . The confidence levels of some temperature trends exceed 99\%, while others are below 80\%. In Alberta's south, annual average temperatures have increased by 1°C to 2°C since the 1950s, but in Alberta's north the increase is 2°C to 4°C. The growing season has lengthened by between one and five weeks since the 1950s, while the number of frost days has declined. The most significant trends observed were increases in mean annual and winter temperatures, and declines in the number of days below −20°C and heating degree days.

                  Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource‐selection functions ({RSFs}) and step‐selection functions ({SSFs}), estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animals. Conceptually, slopes that vary by individual, that is, random coefficient models, could be used to accommodate inter‐individual heterogeneity with either approach. While fitting such models for {RSFs} is possible with standard software for generalized linear mixed‐effects models ({GLMMs}), straightforward and efficient one‐step procedures for fitting {SSFs} with random coefficients are currently lacking.
                
                
                  To close this gap, we take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i.e. the {SSF}) is likelihood‐equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum‐specific fixed intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference for random‐slope models becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, or with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including models without random slopes and mixed conditional regression models fit using a two‐step algorithm.

                    Lutra lutra
                    ), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for {SSFs} and to demonstrate the importance of including individual‐specific slopes when estimating individual‐ and population‐level habitat‐selection parameters.

            In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979–2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

              The decline of many woodland caribou (
              Rangifer tarandus caribou
              ) populations is thought to be linked with habitat disturbances resulting from industrial development, including timber harvesting and its network of haul roads. Defining a disturbance‐abundance relationship offers a tool to assess and potentially manage for the influence of disturbance on caribou abundance. Defining this relationship is challenged by limited historical land use and abundance data, the choice of a disturbance measure, and variability in the relationship between subpopulations and across core versus matrix habitat. For 12 subpopulations of woodland caribou within the southern mountain population, we linked longitudinal caribou abundance data with historical forestry disturbances simulated from forest harvest data. We compared disturbance measures estimating the proportion of forested area commercially harvested with even‐aged, regeneration treatments (cutblocks) and converted to roads for transporting timber within subpopulation‐specific core and matrix habitats as predictors of caribou abundance. Non‐linear mixed models provided evidence that disturbances in matrix habitats negatively influenced caribou abundance, with the effects in core habitat being variable between subpopulations. Of the disturbance types evaluated, the best predictors included roads buffered by 50 m (R50), cutblocks ≤80 years old, and the cumulation of cutblocks ≤80 years old plus roads buffered by 50 m. The top‐ranked model was composed of R50 present in core and in matrix habitats. This model predicted a 42\% (95\% {CI} = 33–51\%) reduction in caribou abundance for every 1\% increase in matrix R50 (holding core R50 constant). Given the lack of pre‐forestry abundance data, we failed to directly derive critical disturbance thresholds; however, our models could be used to estimate subpopulation‐specific habitat‐disturbance thresholds necessary to achieve abundance targets. We recommend that in addition to existing protections of core habitat, few if any new roads should be built in core habitat, and that timber harvest in matrix habitat should be designed to minimize the establishment of associated roads.},

              In many regions of the world, forest management has reduced old forest and simplified forest structure and composition. We hypothesized that such forest degradation has resulted in long-term habitat loss for forest-associated bird species of eastern Canada (130,017 km
              2
              ) which, in turn, has caused bird-population declines. Despite little change in overall forest cover, we found substantial reductions in old forest as a result of frequent clear-cutting and a broad-scale transformation to intensified forestry. Back-cast species distribution models revealed that breeding habitat loss occurred for 66\% of the 54 most common species from 1985 to 2020 and was strongly associated with reduction in old age classes. Using a long-term, independent dataset, we found that habitat amount predicted population size for 94\% of species, and habitat loss was associated with population declines for old-forest species. Forest degradation may therefore be a primary cause of biodiversity decline in managed forest landscapes.},

            State–space models ({SSMs}) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture–recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. {SSMs} are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of {SSMs}, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own {SSMs}. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create {SSMs} that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. We present a review of {SSMs} that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about {SSMs}, introduce new tools to veteran {SSM} users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in‐depth tutorial that demonstrates how {SSMs} can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to {SSMs} that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

            Body temperature affects plants’ and animals’ performance, but these effects are complicated by thermal variation through time within an individual and variation through space among individuals in a population. This review and synthesis describes how the effects of thermal variation—in both time and space—can be estimated by applying a simple, nonlinear averaging scheme. The method is first applied to the temporal variation experienced by an individual, providing an estimate of the individual’s average performance. The method is then applied to the scale-dependent thermal variation among individuals, which is modelled as a 1/f-noise phenomenon. For an individual, thermal variation reduces average performance, lowers the temperature of maximum performance (Topt) and contracts the range of viable temperatures. Thermal variation among individuals similarly reduces performance and lowers Topt, but increases the viable range of average temperatures. These results must be viewed with caution, however, because they do not take into account the time-dependent interaction between body temperature and physiological plasticity. Quantifying these interactions is perhaps the largest challenge for ecological and conservation physiologists as they attempt to predict the effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear relationships between covariates and a response variable of interest are frequently encountered in animal science research. Within statistical models, these nonlinear effects have, traditionally, been handled using a range of approaches, including transformation of the response, parametric nonlinear models based on theory or phenomenological grounds (e.g., lactation curves), or through fixed spline or polynomial terms. If it is desirable to learn the shape of the relationship from the data directly, then generalized additive models ({GAMs}) are an excellent alternative to these traditional approaches. {GAMs} extend the generalized linear model such that the linear predictor includes one or more smooth functions, parameterised using penalised splines. A wiggliness penalty on each function is used to avoid over fitting while estimating the parameters of the spline basis functions to maximise fit to the data without producing an overly complex function. Modern {GAMs} include automatic smoothness selection methods to find an optimal balance between fit and complexity of the estimated functions. Because {GAMs} learn the shapes of functions from the data, the user can avoid forcing a particular model to their data. Here, I provide a brief description of {GAMs} and visually illustrate how they work. I then demonstrate the utility of {GAMs} on three example data sets of increasing complexity, to show i) how learning from data can produce a better fit to data than that of parametric models, ii) how hierarchical {GAMs} can be used to estimate growth data from multiple animals in a single model, and iii) how hierarchical {GAMs} can be used for formal statistical inference in a designed experiment of the effects of exposure to maternal hormones on subsequent growth in Japanese quail.},

              Question
              A warming climate has been linked to changes in the distribution of many species, yet the interactions between climate and other environmental drivers are relatively poorly understood. Mountain regions are expected to be particularly at risk in a warming climate, and in many upland regions land use has also changed dramatically over the past few decades, with densities of grazing livestock often decreasing. Does livestock grazing influence elevational shifts of plant communities?

              Methods
              We use a unique long‐term experimental study at the landscape scale along an altitudinal gradient to study elevational shifts of plant communities and species under high and low sheep densities and in ungrazed conditions.
            
            
              Results
              We show that elevational advance of the whole alpine grassland plant community occurred in the absence of herbivores (with a 3 m elevational advance over 8 yr), but was suppressed at low sheep density. At high sheep density there was a downward shift in plant community composition of 4 m. The average change in median altitude across species was positive in the absence of herbivores, but not significantly different from zero under both grazing treatments. There was no convincing evidence that species from lower altitudes showed a greater elevational advance than species from higher altitudes.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study presents evidence that grazing sheep suppressed an elevational advance of the plant community, suggesting that grazing can limit the altitude of the plant community. This implies that grazing management has the potential to buffer climate‐driven shifts in plant communities. Conversely, the widespread recent changes in land use, with reductions in large herbivore densities in alpine areas, could further increase the vulnerability of alpine communities to warming.},

              Conservation strategies for imperiled species are frequently based on identifying and addressing the probable causes of population decline, an approach known as the declining population paradigm. Causes, however, are frequently linked to demographic outcomes by multiple mechanisms, and failing to target the primary mechanisms can reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of conservation actions. Increasingly, conservation strategies also need to consider emerging threats, such as climate change. Here, we use boreal caribou (
              Rangifer tarandus caribou
              ), a threatened ecotype of woodland caribou, as a case study to illustrate how landscape disturbance and climate change can each exert negative demographic effects on caribou through multiple and complex mechanisms. We reviewed the extensive literature focused on woodland caribou to identify and assess the relative importance of each putative mechanism. While disturbance‐mediated apparent competition, the expansion of novel predators, and altered predator behavior appear to be primary mechanisms dictating past and current declines of caribou, climate change has increasing potential to exert strong direct and indirect effects now and in the future. Predicted climate effects may prevent some populations from regaining self‐sustaining status, despite local conservation actions. Our review revealed several knowledge gaps, notably a lack of clarity on the spatial extent of undisturbed habitat required for caribou populations to be stable. We used outcomes from our review to demonstrate how a mechanistic understanding of population decline can inform habitat‐based conservation strategies for caribou. For populations residing within highly disturbed ranges, habitat restoration is a key recommendation of current conservation strategies, yet the large spatial extent of disturbances will require prioritization of areas for restoration. Maximizing the conservation return‐on‐investment for caribou will require a mechanistically informed prioritization process that targets conservation actions toward the primary mechanisms underlying population decline.},

                    Prey may trade off resource acquisition with mortality risk by using various habitat selection strategies. Empirical assessments have shown that the functional and numerical responses of predators to human disturbances are variable, yet spatial changes in predation risk by two predators have seldom been studied for prey occurring in human‐modified landscapes. Using the boreal caribou
                    Rangifer tarandus caribou
                    – grey wolf
                    Canis lupus
                    – black bear
                    Ursus americanus
                    system in eastern Canada, we investigated whether responses of prey towards one predator could concomitantly increase risk of predation from another predator exhibiting a different foraging tactic.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We investigated trade‐offs made by solitary caribou females and mothers accompanied by their calf during the period of highest calf vulnerability and compared the behaviour of mothers that would eventually lose their calf to predation to that of mothers whose calf survived until the following year. We modelled habitat selection using different metrics of forage based on field measurements and digital maps and developed empirical models of predation risk and prey behaviour using
                    {GPS}
                    data collected on both predators and prey.
                  
                
                
                  Mothers accompanied by their calf seemed to compromise foraging opportunities for safety, as opposed to solitary females who showed no particular avoidance of areas used by predators. Although caribou mothers adopted selection strategies that could have protected their offspring from wolves, females that eventually lost their calf to predation selected for vegetative associations that were favourable to bears.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    . We determined that mothers that most strongly avoided suitable wolf habitat were also those that most strongly selected suitable bear habitat, suggesting that by using antipredator strategies aimed at reducing predation risk from wolves, caribou exposed their offspring to increased predation risk from bears. This result is of paramount conservation value as bears were responsible for 94\% of caribou calf kills in this system. In the short term, conservation efforts for boreal caribou may benefit from the management of bear populations by means of liberal hunting regulations or predator control. In the long term, however, these actions should be used in conjunction with the protection of potential calving areas away from cutblocks and roads.

              ‐mediated apparent competition with more abundant ungulate prey species. While caribou generally persist in areas with low wolf density, wolf packs that overlap caribou ranges could trigger caribou declines. Moreover, anthropogenic linear features such as roads, trails and seismic lines are hypothesized to increase predation risk for caribou, yet few studies have examined the mechanistic effects of linear features or spatial overlap on wolf–caribou encounter rates and predation risk.
            
            
              2.
               We used (a) time‐to‐event models of wolf–caribou encounters estimated from concurrent global positioning system ({GPS}) radio‐collar data from wolves and caribou and (b) wolf resource selection models of travel locations, to determine the potential influence of wolf–caribou spatial overlap, linear features, elevation and season on encounter rates. Analyses were based on data from 35 adult female caribou and 37 male and female wolves from 11 wolf packs from Banff and Jasper National Parks, Canada, from 2002 until 2010.

               Wolf–caribou encounter rates increased with high wolf–caribou overlap, proximity to linear features and lower elevations. Wolves strongly selected low elevations, especially during winter and spring. Selection for linear features as travel routes increased with elevation.

            Although global change can reshape ecosystems by triggering cascading effects on food webs, indirect interactions remain largely overlooked. Climate‐ and land‐use‐induced changes in landscape cause shifts in vegetation composition, which affect entire food webs. We used simulations of forest dynamics and movements of interacting species, parameterized by empirical observations, to predict the outcomes of global change on a large‐mammal food web in the boreal forest. We demonstrate that climate‐ and land‐use‐induced changes in forest landscapes exacerbate asymmetrical apparent competition between moose and threatened caribou populations through wolf predation. Although increased prey mortalities came from both behavioral and numerical responses, indirect effects from numerical responses had an overwhelming effect. The increase in caribou mortalities was exacerbated by the cumulating effects of land use over the short term and climate change impacts over the long term, with higher impact of land use. Indirect trophic interactions will be key to understanding community dynamics under global change.},

We assessed the future of caribou habitat across a region of northeast Alberta using a model of habitat‐quality and projections of future climate from three general circulation models. We used mapped climatic and topo‐edaphic properties to project future upland vegetation cover and a fire simulation model to project the frequency and extent of wildfires. Based on those projections, we quantified the future habitat of caribou according to estimates of nutritional resources and predation risk derived from vegetation cover type and stand age. Grassland vegetation covered up to half of the study area by the 2080s, expanding from {\textless}1\% in the present and contributing to a significant contraction in mixedwood and coniferous forests. This change in vegetation would increase the risk of predation and disease, as habitat becomes more suitable for white‐tailed deer (
              Odocoileus virginianus
              ) and, consequently, gray wolves (
              Canis lupus
              ). Borne out, these changes would severely compromise the long‐term persistence of caribou in the boreal forest of Alberta.},

	abstract = {In highly seasonal environments, offspring production by vertebrates is timed to coincide with the annual peak of resource availability. For herbivores, this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season. As plant phenology advances in response to climatic warming, there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demands by reproducing herbivores and the peak of resource availability. For migratory herbivores, such as caribou, development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer ranges, where calves are born, is cued by changes in day length, while onset of the plant-growing season on the same ranges is cued by local temperatures. Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland, we document the consequences for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plants. As mean spring temperatures at our study site have risen by more than 4°C, caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range. As a consequence, offspring mortality has risen and offspring production has dropped fourfold.},

              Long‐term monitoring is critical to determine the stability and sustainability of wildlife populations, and if change has occurred, why. We have followed population density changes in the small mammal community in the boreal forest of the southern Yukon for 46 years with density estimates by live trapping on 3–5 unmanipulated grids in spring and autumn. This community consists of 10 species and was responsible for 9\% of the energy flow in the herbivore component of this ecosystem from 1986 to 1996, but this increased to 38\% from 2003 to 2014. Small mammals, although small in size, are large in the transfer of energy from plants to predators and decomposers. Four species form the bulk of the biomass. There was a shift in the dominant species from the 1970s to the 2000s, with
              Myodes rutilus
              increasing in relative abundance by 22\% and
              Peromyscus maniculatus
              decreasing by 22\%. From 2007 to 2018,
              Myodes
              comprised 63\% of the catch,
              Peromyscus
              20\%, and
              Microtus
              species 17\%. Possible causes of these changes involve climate change, which is increasing primary production in this boreal forest, and an associated increase in the abundance of 3 rodent predators, marten (
              Martes americana
              ), ermine (
              Mustela ermine
              ) and coyotes (
              Canis latrans
              ). Following and understanding these and potential future changes will require long‐term monitoring studies on a large scale to measure metapopulation dynamics. The small mammal community in northern Canada is being affected by climate change and cannot remain stable. Changes will be critically dependent on food–web interactions that are species‐specific.},

Here, we review the likelihood of continued changes in terrestrial climate, including analyses of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project global climate model ensemble. Inertia toward continued emissions creates potential 21st-century global warming that is comparable in magnitude to that of the largest global changes in the past 65 million years but is orders of magnitude more rapid. The rate of warming implies a velocity of climate change and required range shifts of up to several kilometers per year, raising the prospect of daunting challenges for ecosystems, especially in the context of extensive land use and degradation, changes in frequency and severity of extreme events, and interactions with other stresses.},

              Extreme heat events pose increasing challenges to biodiversity conservation worldwide, yet our ability to predict the time, place and magnitude of their impacts on wildlife is limited. Extreme heat events in Australia are known to kill thousands of flying‐foxes (
              Pteropus
              spp.), and such die‐offs are expected to become more frequent and widespread in the future under anthropogenic climate change. There is a growing need for predicting when and where such heat‐related die‐offs would occur, to facilitate short‐term wildlife management and conservation actions. In this study, we used gridded hourly air temperature forecasts [Australian Community Climate and Earth‐System Simulator ({ACCESS}‐R) Numerical Weather Prediction ({NWP}) model] from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to predict flying‐fox heat‐related mortality based on an empirically determined threshold of 42.0°C. We tested the accuracy and precision of this model using a twofold evaluation of the {ACCESS}‐R {NWP} forecast air temperature during a recorded extreme heat event with
              in situ
              air temperature measurements and interpolated weather station data. While our results showed a slight discrepancy between the modelled and measured air temperatures, there was no significant difference in the forecast's accuracy to predict die‐offs during an extreme heat event and the overall summer period. We evaluated the accuracy of mortality predictions based on different air temperature thresholds (38.0, 40.0, 42.0 and 44.0°C). Our results revealed a significant probability of flying‐fox mortality occurrence when forecast air temperature was ≥42.0°C, while the 24‐ and 48‐h forecasts accurately predicted 77 and 73\% of the die‐offs, respectively. Thus, the use of 42.0°C forecast air temperature from the {ACCESS}‐R {NWP} model can predict flying‐fox mortality reliably at the landscape scale. In principle, the forecaster can be used for any species with known thermal tolerance data and is therefore a promising new tool for prioritizing adaptation actions that aim to conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change.},

              Bio-telemetry from small tags attached to animals is one of the principal methods for studying the ecology and behaviour of wildlife. The field has constantly evolved over the last 80 years as technological improvement enabled a diversity of sensors to be integrated into the tags (e.g., {GPS}, accelerometers, etc.). However, retrieving data from tags on free-ranging animals remains a challenge since satellite and {GSM} networks are relatively expensive and or power hungry. Recently a new class of low-power communication networks have been developed and deployed worldwide to connect the internet of things ({IoT}). Here, we evaluated one of these, the Sigfox {IoT} network, for the potential as a real-time multi-sensor data retrieval and tag commanding system for studying fauna across a diversity of species and ecosystems. We tracked 312 individuals across 30 species (from 25 g bats to 3 t elephants) with seven different device concepts, resulting in more than 177,742 successful transmissions. We found a maximum line of sight communication distance of 280 km (on a flying cape vulture [
              Gyps coprotheres
              ]), which sets a new documented record for animal-borne digital data transmission using terrestrial infrastructure. The average transmission success rate amounted to 68.3\% ({SD} 22.1) on flying species and 54.1\% ({SD} 27.4) on terrestrial species. In addition to {GPS} data, we also collected and transmitted data products from accelerometers, barometers, and thermometers. Further, we assessed the performance of Sigfox Atlas Native, a low-power method for positional estimates based on radio signal strengths and found a median accuracy of 12.89 km ({MAD} 5.17) on animals. We found that robust real-time communication (median message delay of 1.49 s), the extremely small size of the tags (starting at 1.28 g without {GPS}), and the low power demands (as low as 5.8 µAh per transmitted byte) unlock new possibilities for ecological data collection and global animal observation.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
          Estimates of speed and distance traveled are routine in ecological research to provide a link between behavior and energetics. Conventional straight-line displacement ({SLD}) methods return severely and differentially biased estimates with no ability to evaluate the accuracy of the estimate. Recent methodological advances have improved our ability to estimate these parameters using continuous-time speed and distance ({CTSD}) estimation. However, even with {CTSD} estimation, many datasets are too coarse, or the location error is too great to reliably measure speed or distance traveled. To address these limitations, we investigated the relationship between {CTSD}-estimated mean speed and diffusion rate, where diffusion rate is defined as the variance in displacements per time interval. We calculated {CTSD} mean speed and diffusion rate estimates using telemetry data (i.e., trajectory data) from over 100 white-tailed deer and simulated telemetry data generated from a known movement model. We examined the relationship between the two measures in both datasets and the effect of sampling frequency on the effective sample size and the estimation of the two parameters. We found that mean speed and diffusion rate were strongly and nonlinearly correlated, with a 1\% increase in diffusion rate predicting a 0.40\% increase in mean speed (99\% {CI}: 0.38–0.42\%) for our focal species. Diffusion rate estimates remained substantially more accurate and precise than speed across sampling interval regimes, even when speed estimation was not possible. Our findings demonstrate that diffusion rate outperforms mean speed as a measure of movement activity under marginal data conditions. Diffusion rate is a reliable measure of movement activity and can link behavior to energetics across a wider range of datasets while maintaining accuracy even when data quality is low. By using speed and diffusion together, researchers can rely on more robust insights into space use across a range of ecological contexts.},

              Most species exhibit periodic behaviors in response to cycles in resources and risks in the environment (circadian, lunar, seasonal, and so on). The ability to respond to anthropogenic perturbations by modifying periodic behaviors remains little studied, as does the question of whether and how periodic behaviors translate into periodic patterns in animal space use, on which we focus. Extending existing continuous‐time stochastic movement models, we propose two new parametric approaches to detect and quantify periodic patterns of space use in animal tracking data, via periodicity in the expected position or circulation in the stochastic component of the path. We use them to study the movements of maned wolves (
              Chrysocyon brachyurus
              ) and coyotes (
              Canis latrans
              ) along anthropization gradients. These case studies illustrate how periodic patterns can be of natural origin (cycles in the environment) or anthropogenic origin (periodicity in human activity or restrictions on available habitat), suggesting a role for periodic patterns of space use in species persistence in anthropized areas. The method builds upon and extends existing functionalities in the R‐package ctmm, in which the necessary tools are made available.},

              Use of downscaled global climate model projections is expanding rapidly as climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning become mainstream in many sectors. Many climate change impact analyses use climate model projections downscaled at very high spatial resolution ({\textasciitilde}1 km) but very low temporal resolution (20‐ to 30‐year normals). These applications have model selection priorities that are distinct from analyses at high temporal resolution. Here, we select a 13‐model ensemble and an 8‐model subset designed for robust change‐factor downscaling of monthly climate normals, and describe their attributes in North America. All models are selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ({CMIP}6) archives. The 13‐model ensemble is representative of the distribution of equilibrium climate sensitivity, grid resolution, and transient regional climate changes in the {CMIP}6 generation. The 8‐model subset is consistent with the {IPCC}'s recent assessment of the
              very likely
              range of Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity. Our results emphasize several principles for selection and use of downscaled climate ensembles: (a) the ensemble must be observationally constrained to be meaningful; (b) analysis of multiple models is essential as the ensemble mean alone can be misleading; (c) small ({\textless}8‐member) ensembles should be region‐specific and used with caution; (d) higher grid resolution is not necessarily better; and (e) multiple simulations of each model/scenario combination are necessary to represent precipitation uncertainty. Although we have focused our documentation on North America, our model selection uses primarily global criteria and is applicable to downscaling climate normals in other continents. Downscaled projections for the selected models are available in {ClimateNA} (
              http://climatena.ca/
              ). An accompanying web application (
              https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/cmip6-{NA}/
              ) provides tools for further model selection and visualization of the ensemble.},

            In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979–2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

          Climate change is increasingly disrupting evolved life history strategies and reducing population viability in wild species. Using estimates of epigenetic age acceleration, a cellular biomarker of lifetime stress and the expression of age-related phenotypes, we found that polar bears aged approximately one year faster for each degree of warming since the 1960s. Age acceleration was also associated with reproducing early in life, linking this cellular process to well-established life history theory. However, we found evidence for the erosion of fitness as epigenetic aging accelerated and temperatures increased. Finally, using a large pedigree, we found adaptive potential in our study population was approximately zero. Global temperatures will soon reach the levels of warming currently experienced by Arctic species, which could impose widespread physiological costs and limit adaptive capacities worldwide.},

              Translocation and captivity are important tools for conservation biology and wildlife management. Understanding the movement ecology of animals following their release in novel terrain is critical to predicting the success of wildlife restoration efforts. Mountain caribou have high conservation value – efforts to restore their populations across western Canada involve hundreds of millions of dollars in science, monitoring, and management activity. Here, we examined the movements of adult female caribou (
              N
               = 36) following their translocation to, and release from, a maternity pen (‘penned caribou’) and compared these movements to animals that were not translocated (‘unpenned caribou’,
              N
               = 22). A maternity pen is a temporary holding facility, within the animals’ existing range, that enables them to bear and raise their young in the absence of predators and with augmented resources. Penned and unpenned animals had similar home range sizes (1052.2 and 1314.6 km
              2
              , respectively,
              P
               = 0.46) though penned animals moved through the landscape in a faster yet less directed manner. We found some evidence that memory may improve the efficiency of space use. Home ranges with higher quality habitats tended to be smaller than home ranges with poorer quality habitats irrespective of penning status. Penned animals ranged at lower elevation ({\textasciitilde}150 m) than unpenned animals, particularly in spring and early winter. For penned animals, we did not detect evidence of homing back to the original capture site. The best predictor of how caribou will use the landscape appears to be proximity to the location of the release site. To maximize the fitness of released caribou, future plans for maternity pens and captive breeding programs need to consider the management of food, predators, and habitat across the 1000–2000 km
              2
              that will form the home range near the release site.},

              Anthropogenic habitat alteration and climate change are two well‐known contributors to biodiversity loss through changes to species distribution and abundance; yet, disentangling the effects of these two factors is often hindered by their inherent confound across both space and time. We leveraged a contrast in habitat alteration associated with the jurisdictional boundary between two Canadian provinces to evaluate the relative effects of spatial variation in habitat alteration and climate on white‐tailed deer (
              Odocoileus virginianus
              ) densities. White‐tailed deer are an invading ungulate across much of North America, whose expansion into Canada's boreal forest is implicated in the decline of boreal caribou (
              Rangifer tarandus caribou
              ), a species listed as Threatened in Canada. We estimated white‐tailed deer densities using 300 remote cameras across 12 replicated 50 km
              2
              landscapes over 5 years. White‐tailed deer densities were significantly lower in areas where winter severity was higher. For example, predicted deer densities declined from 1.83 to 0.35 deer/km
              2
              when winter severity increased from the lowest value to the median value. There was a tendency for densities to increase with increasing habitat alteration; however, the magnitude of this effect was approximately half that of climate. Our findings suggest that climate is the primary driver of white‐tailed deer populations; however, understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship requires further study of over‐winter survival and fecundity. Long‐term monitoring at the invasion front is needed to evaluate the drivers of abundance over time, particularly given the unpredictability of climate change and increasing prevalence of extreme weather events.},

              Human‐caused habitat change has been implicated in current woodland caribou (
              Rangifer tarandus caribou
              ) population declines across North America. Increased early seral habitat associated with industrial footprint can result in an increase in ungulate densities and subsequently those of their predator, wolves (
              Canis lupus
              ). Higher wolf densities can result in increased encounters between wolves and caribou and consequently higher caribou mortality. We contrasted changes in moose (
              Alces alces
              ) and deer (
              Odocoileus
              spp.) densities and assessed their effects on wolf–caribou dynamics in northeastern Alberta, Canada, pre (1994–1997) versus post (2005–2009) major industrial expansion in the region. Observable white‐tailed deer (
              O. virginianus
              ) increased 17.5‐fold but moose remained unchanged. Wolf numbers also increased from approximately 6–11.5/1,000 km
              2
              . Coincident with these changes, spatial overlap between wolf pack territories and caribou range was high relative to the mid‐1990s. The high number of wolf locations in caribou range suggests that forays were not merely exploratory, but rather represented hunting forays and denning locations. Scat analysis indicated that wolf consumption of moose declined substantively during this time period, whereas use of deer increased markedly and deer replaced moose as the primary prey of wolves. Caribou increased 10‐fold in the diet of wolves and caribou population trends in the region changed from stable to declining. Wolf use of beaver (
              Castor canadensis
              ) increased since the mid‐1990s. We suggest that recent declines in woodland caribou populations in the southerly extent of their range have occurred because high deer densities resulted in a numeric response by wolves and consequently higher incidental predation on caribou. Our results indicate that management actions to conserve caribou must now include deer in primary prey and wolf reduction programs. © 2010 The Wildlife Society},

Resource selection function ({RSF}) modeling provides a powerful tool for assessing the effects of industrial development on spatial use patterns of wildlife. Among North American large mammal species, mountain goats
              Oreamnos americanus
              are particularly sensitive to human disturbance. In this study mountain goat seasonal resource selection patterns were examined using {GPS} radio collar (n = 79 individuals) and remote sensing data in a {GIS} framework across a 491 km
              2
              regional mountain range in southeast Alaska, 2005–2015. The resulting global {RSF} model was then applied across a limited spatial extent centered on an industrial mining site in order to assess whether mining activity altered expected spatial use patterns at different distances from the mine. Using a quasi treatment—control experimental framework we examined the occurrence of spatially explicit mine disturbance thresholds. In general, resource selection modeling indicated that mountain goats selected for steep, rugged terrain in close proximity to cliffs in areas with high solar exposure; and they selected for lower elevations in winter than in summer. Mountain goat selection for rugged terrain and proximity to cliffs was stronger in winter than summer. {RSF} model applications indicated that mountain goat use of predicted habitat in close proximity to the mine was lower than expected at distances up to 1800 m in winter and 1000 m in summer. Because lower elevation winter habitat is closer to mining activity than summer habitat, a greater percentage (42\%) of winter habitat within the analysis area was affected by mining activity. The resulting net loss of functional winter habitat carrying capacity is likely to have long‐term negative implications for the local mountain goat population. In places where mining is proposed, development should avoid areas within 1800 m of mountain goat winter habitat. In places where mining is already occurring within disturbance thresholds (such as this study), long‐term monitoring and more detailed field studies should be conducted to more fully understand population‐level consequences of disturbance and identify practicable mitigation measures that have a high probability of success.},

            In the province of British Columbia, Canada, four of the most severe wildfire seasons of the last century occurred in the past 7 years: 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2023. To investigate trends in wildfire activity and fire-conducive climate, we conducted an analysis of mapped wildfire perimeters and annual climate data for the period of 1919–2021. Results show that after a century-long decline, fire activity increased from 2005 onwards, coinciding with a sharp reversal in the wetting trend of the 20th century. Even as precipitation levels remain high, moisture deficits have increased due to rapid warming and increased evaporative demand. Bottom-up factors further influence fire activity, as the legacy of past wildfires, insect outbreaks, and land-use practices continually influence fire regimes. The compound effects of climate-induced moisture changes and altered fuels now force British Columbians to confront the harsh reality of more frequent years of intense and prolonged wildfire activity.},

            Forests worldwide have undergone rapid changes; however, understanding the causes of the changes has been a challenge. Climate on the regional scale has been overwhelmingly presumed to drive these changes, with little attention paid to the possible effects of competition. We compiled a long-term forest dataset from western Canada to study the relative importance of climate change and competition on tree growth, mortality, and recruitment. We showed that competition was the primary factor causing the long-term changes. Regional climate had a weaker yet significant effect on tree mortality, but no effect on tree growth and recruitment. This finding suggests that forest studies focused solely on the effects of climate may overlook the effect of other processes critical to forest dynamics.
          , 
            Tree mortality, growth, and recruitment are essential components of forest dynamics and resiliency, for which there is great concern as climate change progresses at high latitudes. Tree mortality has been observed to increase over the past decades in many regions, but the causes of this increase are not well understood, and we know even less about long-term changes in growth and recruitment rates. Using a dataset of long-term (1958–2009) observations on 1,680 permanent sample plots from undisturbed natural forests in western Canada, we found that tree demographic rates have changed markedly over the last five decades. We observed a widespread, significant increase in tree mortality, a significant decrease in tree growth, and a similar but weaker trend of decreasing recruitment. However, these changes varied widely across tree size, forest age, ecozones, and species. We found that competition was the primary factor causing the long-term changes in tree mortality, growth, and recruitment. Regional climate had a weaker yet still significant effect on tree mortality, but little effect on tree growth and recruitment. This finding suggests that internal community-level processes—more so than external climatic factors—are driving forest dynamics.},

            Global and national commitments to slow biodiversity loss by expanding protected area networks also provide opportunities to evaluate conservation priorities in the face of climate change. Using recently developed indicators of climatic macrorefugia, environmental diversity, and corridors, we conducted a systematic, climate‐informed prioritization of conservation values across North America. We explicitly considered complementarity of multiple conservation objectives, capturing key niche‐based temperature and moisture thresholds for 324 tree species and 268 songbird species. Conservation rankings were influenced most strongly by climate corridors and species‐specific refugia layers. Although areas of high conservation value under climate change were partially aligned with existing protected areas, ∼80\% of areas within the top quintile of biome‐level conservation values lack formal protection. Results from this study and application of our approach elsewhere can help improve the long‐term value of conservation investments at multiple spatial scales.},

Through global synthesis, we used 25,950 matched data pairs from 264 studies in 53 countries to assess how delivery of climate, soil, water, and wood production services, in addition to biodiversity, compares across a range of tree plantations and native forests. Benefits of aboveground carbon storage, water provisioning, and especially soil erosion control and biodiversity are better delivered by native forests, with compositionally simpler, younger plantations in drier regions performing particularly poorly. However, plantations exhibit an advantage in wood production. These results underscore important trade-offs among environmental and production goals that policy-makers must navigate in meeting forest restoration commitments.

Synthesizing data from the world’s major forest biomes, they found that native forests consistently delivered better performance than plantations in the provision of the three major ecosystem services, with additional benefits for biodiversity. The discrepancy was particularly marked in in warmer and drier regions. These findings show that the benefits of reforestation will be best achieved through the restoration of native forests rather than extensive plantation programs. —{AMS}

            As evidenced by past climatic refugia, locations projected to harbor remnants of present‐day climates may serve as critical refugia for current biodiversity in the face of modern climate change. We mapped potential climatic refugia in the future across North America, defined as locations with increasingly rare climatic conditions. We identified these locations by tracking projected changes in the size and distribution of climate analogs over time. We used biologically derived thresholds to define analogs and tested the impacts of dispersal limitation with 4 distances to limit analog searches. We identified at most 12\% of North America as potential climatic refugia. Refugia extent varied depending on the analog threshold, dispersal distance, and climate projection. However, in all cases refugia were concentrated at high elevations and in topographically complex regions. Refugia identified using different climate projections were largely nested, suggesting that identified refugia were relatively robust to climate‐projection selection. Existing conservation areas cover approximately 10\% of North America and yet protected up to 25\% of identified refugia, indicating that protected areas disproportionately include refugia. Refugia located at lower latitudes (≤40°N) and slightly lower elevations (approximately 2500 m) were more likely to be unprotected. Based on our results, a 23\% expansion of the protected‐area network would be sufficient to protect the refugia present under all 3 climate projections we explored. We believe these refugia are high conservation priorities due to their potential to harbor rare species in the future. However, these locations are simultaneously highly vulnerable to climate change over the long term. These refugia contracted substantially between the 2050s and the 2080s, which supports the idea that the pace of climate change will strongly determine the availability and effectiveness of refugia for protecting today's biodiversity.

              Distribución y Protección de los Refugios Climáticos en América del Norte
              
                Resumen
                Los refugios climáticos pasados han evidenciado que las localidades proyectadas para albergar remanentes de los climas actuales pueden fungir como refugios importantes para la biodiversidad contemporánea de frente al cambio climático actual. Mapeamos los refugios climáticos potenciales en el futuro a lo largo de América del Norte, definidos como localidades con condiciones climáticas cada vez más raras. Identificamos estas localidades rastreando los cambios proyectados en el tamaño y distribución de los análogos climáticos en el transcurso del tiempo. Usamos umbrales derivados biológicamente para definir estos análogos y probamos los impactos de la limitación de la dispersión con cuatro distancias para limitar las búsquedas análogas. Identificamos, cuando mucho, el 12\% de América del Norte como refugios climáticos potenciales. La extensión de los refugios varió dependiendo del umbral análogo, la distancia de dispersión y la proyección climática. Sin embargo, los refugios estuvieron concentrados en elevaciones altas y en regiones complejas topográficamente en todos los casos. Los refugios que fueron identificados usando diferentes proyecciones climáticas estuvieron anidados en general, lo que sugiere que estos refugios identificados fueron relativamente sólidos con respecto a la selección de proyección climática. Las áreas de conservación existentes cubren aproximadamente el 10\% de América del Norte y aun así protegieron hasta el 25\% de los refugios identificados, lo que indica que las áreas protegidas incluyen desproporcionadamente refugios climáticos. Los refugios localizados a latitudes menores (≤40°N) y a elevaciones ligeramente menores (aproximadamente 2500 m) tuvieron una mayor probabilidad de no estar protegidos. Con base en nuestros resultados, una expansión del 23\% de la red de áreas protegidas debería ser suficiente para proteger los refugios presentes en las tres proyecciones climáticas que exploramos. Creemos que estos refugios climáticos son de prioridad alta para la conservación debido a su potencial para albergar especies raras en el futuro. Sin embargo, estas localidades también son altamente vulnerables al cambio climático a largo plazo. Estos refugios se redujeron sustancialmente entre las décadas de 2050 y 2080, lo que refuerza la idea de que el paso del cambio climático determinará con fuerza la disponibilidad y efectividad de los refugios climáticos para proteger a la biodiversidad contemporánea.

            北美气候庇护所的分布及保护
            
              【摘要】
              过去的气候庇护所数据可以证明, 在现代气候变化的情况下, 那些被预测可以保留残存物种的地区可能是当前生物多样性的重要庇护所。我们绘制了北美地区未来潜在的气候庇护所地图, 对气候庇护所的定义是那些罕见气候条件日益增加的地区, 我们主要是通过追踪相似气候在大小和分布上随时间的预计变化确定了这些地区。我们用生物学的临界值来定义相似气候, 并通过分析四种不同扩散距离限制的影响来限定对相似气候的搜寻范围。本研究发现北美洲至多有12\%的地区是潜在气候庇护所。庇护所的范围随相似气候的临界值、扩散距离和气候预测模型而变化。然而, 在所有案例中, 庇护所都集中在那些海拔高、地形复杂的地区。用不同气候预测模型确定的庇护所很大程度上是相互嵌套的, 这表明它们对气候预测模型的选择相对稳健。目前, 现有的保护地覆盖了北美约10\%的地区, 保护着高达25\%经确定的庇护所, 这说明保护地不成比例地囊括了庇护所, 而那些位于低纬度地区 (≤40°N) 和较低海拔 (约2500米) 的庇护所更有可能仍未受到保护。根据我们的结果, 保护地网络扩大23\%就足以保护我们分析的三种气候预测模型下存在的庇护所。我们相信这些庇护所应得到优先保护, 因为它们有潜力在未来为珍稀物种提供栖息地。然而, 从长期来看, 这些地区同时非常容易受到气候变化的影响。它们可能在21世纪50到80年代大幅度缩小, 这支持了气候变化的速度将大大影响庇护所对于保护当前生物多样性的可用性及有效性的观点。

While it is clear that the event was extreme, it is not obvious whether other areas in the world have also experienced events so far outside their natural variability. Using a novel assessment of heat extremes, we investigate how extreme this event was in the global context. Characterizing the relative intensity of an event as the number of standard deviations from the mean, the western North America heat wave is remarkable, coming in at over four standard deviations. Throughout the globe, where we have reliable data, only five other heat waves were found to be more extreme since 1960. We find that in both reanalyses and climate projections, the statistical distribution of extremes increases through time, in line with the distribution mean shift due to climate change. Regions that, by chance, have not had a recent extreme heat wave may be less prepared for potentially imminent events.

            Acting as a top-down control on fire activity, climate strongly affects wildfire in North American ecosystems through fuel moisture and ignitions. Departures from historical fire regimes due to climate change have significant implications for the structure and composition of boreal forests, as well as fire management and operations. In this research, we characterize the relationship between trends in climate and fire regime characteristics, for a study area predominantly in Alberta, Canada. We examined trends of fire and climate in northwestern boreal forests using time series analysis of downscaled historical annual climate, fire history (1970–2019), and fire severity (the impacts of wildfire on plants and organic biomass; 1985–2018). We represented fire severity using the relativized burn ratio ({RBR}) calculated from multispectral Landsat imagery. The climate of the study area has significantly warmed and dried over the past 50 years. Over the same period the annual number of large wildfires, area burned, and fire sizes in the study area significantly increased. Furthermore, the likelihood, area, and number of extreme short-interval reburns (≤15 years between fires; 1985–2019) also significantly increased. During the study period, the portion of forested unburned islands within fire perimeters significantly declined, and fire severity ({RBR}) increased in open conifer and mixedwood forests. These fire regime changes are significantly correlated with annual climate variability, and a path analysis supports the hypothesis that annual climate patterns have led to fire regime shifts. The increasing fire activity in this region has implications for forest ecology and habitat availability, as the disruption of the fire regime is likely to alter forest recovery. Managers may face increasing challenges to fire suppression if the observed trends of increasing hotter and drier annual climate in the study area persist, driving extreme fire activity.},
