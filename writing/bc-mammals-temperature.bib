              Background
              Speed and distance traveled provide quantifiable links between behavior and energetics, and are among the metrics most routinely estimated from animal tracking data. Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements ({SLDs}) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, {SLD} estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty.
            
            
              Methods
              To overcome the limitations of {SLD} estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance ({CTSD}) estimation method. An inherent property of working in continuous-time is the ability to separate the underlying continuous-time movement process from the discrete-time sampling process, making these models less sensitive to the sampling schedule when estimating parameters. The first step of {CTSD} is to estimate the device’s error parameters to calibrate the measurement error. Once the errors have been calibrated, model selection techniques are employed to identify the best fit continuous-time movement model for the data. A simulation-based approach is then employed to sample from the distribution of trajectories conditional on the data, from which the mean speed estimate and its confidence intervals can be extracted.
            
            
              Results
              Using simulated data, we demonstrate how {CTSD} provides accurate, scale-insensitive estimates with reliable confidence intervals. When applied to empirical {GPS} data, we found that {SLD} estimates varied substantially with sampling frequency, whereas {CTSD} provided relatively consistent estimates, with often dramatic improvements over {SLD}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The methods described in this study allow for the computationally efficient, scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled, without biases due to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, or the amount of measurement error. In addition to being robust to the sampling schedule, the point estimates come equipped with confidence intervals, permitting formal statistical inference. All the methods developed in this study are now freely available in the  package or the  point-and-click web based graphical user interface.},

              For free-ranging animals living in seasonal environments, hypometabolism (lowered metabolic rate) and hypothermia (lowered body temperature) can be effective physiological strategies to conserve energy when forage resources are low. To what extent such strategies are adopted by large mammals living under extreme conditions, as those encountered in the high Arctic, is largely unknown, especially for species where the gestation period overlaps with the period of lowest resource availability (i.e. winter). Here we investigated for the first time the level to which high arctic muskoxen (
              Ovibos moschatus
              ) adopt hypothermia and tested the hypothesis that individual plasticity in the use of hypothermia depends on reproductive status. We measured core body temperature over most of the gestation period in both free-ranging muskox females in Greenland and captive female muskoxen in Alaska. We found divergent overwintering strategies according to reproductive status, where pregnant females maintained stable body temperatures during winter, while non-pregnant females exhibited a temporary decrease in their winter body temperature. These results show that muskox females use hypothermia during periods of resource scarcity, but also that the use of this strategy may be limited to non-reproducing females. Our findings suggest a trade-off between metabolically-driven energy conservation during winter and sustaining foetal growth, which may also apply to other large herbivores living in highly seasonal environments elsewhere.},

	abstract = {In a previous analysis, six major threats to at-risk species in Canada were quantified: habitat loss, introduced species, over-exploitation, pollution, native species interactions, and natural causes (O. Venter et al. 2006. Bioscience, 56(11): 903–910). Because of rapid environmental change in Canada and an enhanced understanding of the drivers of species endangerment, we updated the 2005 analysis and tested for changes in threats up until the end of 2018. We also expanded the scope to acknowledge climate change as a seventh major threat to species, given its increasing importance for reshaping biological communities. Using information on the {COSEWIC} (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) website, we scored the threats for each of 814 species. Habitat loss remained the most important anthropogenic threat to Canada’s at-risk species, affecting 82\% of species, followed by over-exploitation (47\%), introduced species (46\%), and pollution (35\%). Climate change was the least important threat, affecting only 13\% of species. However, report writers used less certain language when talking about climate change compared with other threats, so when we included cases where climate change was listed as a probable or future cause, climate change was the fourth most important anthropogenic threat, affecting some 38\% of species. The prevalence of threat categories was broadly similar to those for the United States and {IUCN} listed species. The taxa most affected by climate change included lichens (77\%), birds (63\%), marine mammals (60\%), and Arctic species of all taxa (79\%), whereas vascular plants (23\%), marine fishes (24\%), arthropods (27\%), and non-Arctic species (35\%) were least affected. A paired analysis of the 188 species with two or more reports indicated that any mention of climate change as a threat increased from 12\% to 50\% in 10 years. Other anthropogenic threats that have increased significantly over time in the paired analysis included introduced species, over-exploitation, and pollution. Our analysis suggests that threats are changing rapidly over time, emphasizing the need to monitor future trends of all threats, including climate change.},

Many different kinds of animals employ hibernation, and there is a spectrum of hibernation phenotypes. Here, we focus on obligatory mammalian hibernators to identify the unique challenges they face and the adaptations that allow hibernators to overcome them. This includes the cellular and molecular strategies used to combat low environmental and body temperatures and lack of food and water. We discuss metabolic, neuronal, and hormonal cues that regulate hibernation and how they are thought to be coordinated by internal clocks.

Studies from the last century and more recent work reveal that hibernation is not simply a passive reduction in body temperature and vital parameters but rather an active process seasonally regulated at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.},

              Torpor is a well-known energy conservation strategy in many mammal and bird species. It is often employed when environmental conditions are unfavourable to maximize survival probabilities. However, torpor often carries with it the physiological costs of a low body temperature and of rewarming in addition to potential missed opportunities for foraging. Therefore, we hypothesised that decision making regarding when to use torpor should reflect the most important environmental conditions for species distributions, and thus how they may be impacted by ongoing climate change. We investigated how weather conditions affect nightly torpor patterns in the nocturnal insectivorous Australian eastern long-eared bat (
              Nyctophilus bifax
              ). By measuring the skin temperature of 37 free-ranging individuals, we confirmed that torpor was used more frequently during the winter and at subtropical compared to tropical locations. Using mixed-effect models we show that lower ambient temperatures were the main driver of individual torpor use, probably due to lower roost temperatures and prey availability. However, increased rain, wind and humidity, and decreasing barometric pressure, as well as brighter moonlight, also led to more time spent torpid per night. We suggest that bats evaluate multiple environmental cues to make decisions regarding torpor use versus active foraging based upon their expectations of the energetic benefits, prey availability and relative predation risk. Interactions between some of these effects and body mass (whilst controlling for forearm length) indicate that individual variation in body size and/or state-dependent effects of energy reserves also partly determined the use of nightly torpor in these bats.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium , 4th century B.C.)},

Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal “movement ecology” (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences. , Animal tracking in a big data world So-called “big-data” approaches have revolutionized fields of research from astronomy to genetics. Such approaches are not limited to fields that seem inherently technical, because the combination of rapid data collection and advanced analytical techniques could be applied to almost any scientific question. Nathan et al . reviewed how these modern approaches are being applied to the very old field of animal tracking and monitoring. Large-scale data collection can reveal details about how animals use their environment and interact with each other that were impossible to explore previously. Such methodological shifts will open new avenues of research—and conservation—across species. —{SNV} , A review suggests that modern “big-data” techniques are vastly increasing our understanding of animal movement and its ecology. , {BACKGROUND} Movement is ubiquitous across the natural world. All organisms move, actively or passively, regularly or during specific life stages, as a result of varied proximate drivers including energetic demands, social interactions, competition or predation. Movement closely interacts with individual fitness, affects a myriad of ecological processes, and is crucial for animals’ ability to cope with human-induced rapid environmental changes. Driven by advances in analytical methods and technologies for tracking mammals, birds, fish, and other free-ranging vertebrates (hereafter, wildlife), movement ecology is rapidly transforming into a data-rich discipline, following previous developments in fields such as genomics and environmental monitoring. This ongoing revolution is facilitated by cost-effective automated high-throughput wildlife tracking systems that generate massive high-resolution datasets across scales relevant to the ecological context in which animals perceive, interact with, and respond to their environment. {ADVANCES} Modern tracking technologies efficiently generate copious, accurate information on the movements of multiple individual animals in the wild. Reverse-{GPS} technologies, which primarily use acoustic signals under water and radio signals over land, are automated high-throughput systems that are highly cost- and power-effective and capable of simultaneous tracking of multiple small animals (e.g., 20-g birds) at high spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., 1-s interval, a few meters) for months, but they require system installation and are usually limited to regional scales (≤100 km wide). {GPS}-based systems are, by contrast, readily available, longer term, and cover nearly global scales, but are similarly spatially accurate and periodically capable of high-resolution tracking at regional scales. However, they are more cost- and power-demanding, limited to larger animals, and cannot be applied under water. Two other tracking technologies, radar and computer vision, permit high-resolution snapshots of the movement of multiple individuals and can noninvasively track nontagged animals, but are less cost-effective, usually limited to smaller scales, and make individual identification challenging. Combined, these high-throughput technologies enable groundbreaking research in animal behavior, cognitive sciences, evolution, and ecology, facilitating previously infeasible investigation of animal movement ecology. Big movement data can help link interindividual variation in movement to individual behavior, traits, cognition and physiology; divulge fine-scale interactions within or among species; improve evidence-based management of human-wildlife interactions; and elucidate behavioral changes across spatiotemporal scales. {OUTLOOK} High-throughput wildlife tracking technologies are opening new research frontiers in biology and ecology. Their advantages, however, come with typical big-data costs such as computational load, intensive data management and processing, and challenging statistical analyses. Enlisting fields with a longer history of big data offers new prospects to address these challenges. Progress will arise from combining observational and experimental movement ecology and data-rich studies revealing behavioral shifts across individuals, species, scales, ecosystems, and life stages. High-resolution wildlife tracking is currently infeasible at large to global scales, a key limitation that can be addressed by combining low- and high-rate sampling, increasing interoperability between technologies, standardizing and sharing data, and promoting multidisciplinary international collaboration. Coupling movement and environmental big data could help determine impacts of major environmental and climate changes on animal–environment interactions, whereas real-time movement data could uniquely inform biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Why do high-throughput movement data matter? Big movement data are essential for addressing key ecological questions, as conclusions based on traditional lower-resolution data could differ markedly from the correct conclusions. We illustrate several examples for contrasting conclusions derived from lower- versus higher-resolution data of the same tracks from the same number of animals. Higher-resolution data can reveal that bolder birds visit more sites across the landscape and that bird tracks frequently cross each other, suggesting high potential for disease transmission, and that fish avoid fisheries and frequently search locally within small patches. None of these conclusions, however, could have been drawn from lower-resolution data. See also movies S1 to S5.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            During deep snow conditions, wildlife must balance between minimizing movements to conserve energy while seeking high amounts of browse to gain the energy. Knowledge of how snow begins to hinder their movements is therefore vital when predicting their wintertime behavior. We assessed the phenomenon with moose. Movement data from 122 {GPS}-collared moose were integrated with snow depth data from designated measurement stations. The effects of increasing snow depths on moose movement rates were then modeled with spline regression. The study was conducted in Finland, between 2009 and 2011. The moose were known for their sex and for the presence of calf at heel. On average, the movement rates decreased sharply until snow depths of ca. 30–40 cm, after which further significant decreases were not seen. The movement rates decreased from several kilometers per day to less than 500 m per day. Moose in the northernmost study area with the deepest snow covers moved as much as the moose in the other areas with less snow. Although we saw differences in the movement rates between males and females, differences between individuals were markedly higher than those caused by sex or a calf at heel. Moose are keystone species whose heavy browsing, especially during winter, can have profound effects on vegetation and forest regeneration. As snow covers in large parts of the boreal zone are predicted to decrease due to warming climate, the wintertime movements of moose and how they affect the local vegetation will remain relevant questions.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study : speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable.
            This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores ; four species of primates ; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species):
            
            where has the units ml O2 s−1 kg−1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s−1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Ėmetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20·1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible :
            
            where Ėmetab/Mb has the units watts/kg.
            This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \& Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this general equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25 \% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.},

            A spatially explicit capture-recapture ({SCR}) model was applied to estimate simultaneously population parameters and individual activity (i.e. home range size) of O. vulgaris, based on experimental mark-recapture data in a human-altered Mediterranean coastal area. Seventy-two octopuses were captured, tagged with subcutaneous {PIT}-tags and released. Nineteen tagged individuals were recaptured (recapture rate: 26.4\%) in the same area over the study period, which spanned over 6 months. Population sizes and densities decreased over the study period, from 337 octopuses (8 ind. ha−1) in September-October to 105 octopuses (2.5 ind. ha−1) in February-March. The highest recruitment probability was estimated to occur at the beginning of the study but it clearly decreased over time, while mortality probability during a fishing period slightly increased. Mean specific growth rate was 0.82 ± 0.11 day−1. Individual home range or activity area ranged from 2.8 ha to 7.3 ha (median home range radius: 121.8 m). Overall, these results suggest that human-altered coastal habitats, which are characterized by abundant shelters, abundant food and absence of predators, can act as settlement and growth areas for juveniles and adults of O. vulgaris. Furthermore, the methodologies applied in this study are recommended as innovative tools to improve management actions of coastal resources.},

	abstract = {The green wave hypothesis ({GWH}) states that migrating animals should track or ‘surf’ high-quality forage at the leading edge of spring green-up. To index such high-quality forage, recent work proposed the instantaneous rate of green-up ({IRG}), i.e. rate of change in the normalized difference vegetation index over time. Despite this important advancement, no study has tested the assumption that herbivores select habitat patches at peak {IRG}. We evaluated this assumption using step selection functions parametrized with movement data during the green-up period from two populations each of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, moose and bison, totalling 463 individuals monitored 1–3 years from 2004 to 2014. Accounting for variables that typically influence habitat selection for each species, we found seven of 10 populations selected patches exhibiting high {IRG}—supporting the {GWH}. Nonetheless, large herbivores selected for the leading edge, trailing edge and crest of the {IRG} wave, indicating that other mechanisms (e.g. ruminant physiology) or measurement error inherent with satellite data affect selection for {IRG}. Our evaluation indicates that {IRG} is a useful tool for linking herbivore movement with plant phenology, paving the way for significant advancements in understanding how animals track resource quality that varies both spatially and temporally.},

We used infrared thermography to explore how lower passive heat dissipation during flight impacts body-heat management in broad-billed (

Thermal gradients persisted at higher temperatures in smaller species, possibly allowing them to inhabit warmer sites. All species experienced extended daytime periods lacking thermal gradients. Broad-billed hummingbirds lacking thermal gradients regulated the mean total-body surface temperature at approximately 38°C, suggesting behavioural thermoregulation. Blue-throated hummingbirds were inactive when lacking passive heat dissipation and hence might have the lowest temperature tolerance of the four species. Use of thermal refugia permitted hummingbirds to tolerate higher temperatures, but climate change could eliminate refugia, forcing distributional shifts in hummingbird populations.},

	abstract = {Movement is critical to animal survival and, thus, biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Increasing fragmentation in the Anthropocene necessitates predictions about the movement capacities of the multitude of species that inhabit natural ecosystems. This requires mechanistic, trait-based animal locomotion models, which are sufficiently general as well as biologically realistic. While larger animals should generally be able to travel greater distances, reported trends in their maximum speeds across a range of body sizes suggest limited movement capacities among the largest species. Here, we show that this also applies to travel speeds and that this arises because of their limited heat-dissipation capacities. We derive a model considering how fundamental biophysical constraints of animal body mass associated with energy utilisation (i.e., larger animals have a lower metabolic energy cost of locomotion) and heat-dissipation (i.e., larger animals require more time to dissipate metabolic heat) limit aerobic travel speeds. Using an extensive empirical dataset of animal travel speeds (532 species), we show that this
              allometric heat-dissipation model
              best captures the hump-shaped trends in travel speed with body mass for flying, running, and swimming animals. This implies that the inability to dissipate metabolic heat leads to the saturation and eventual decrease in travel speed with increasing body mass as larger animals must reduce their realised travel speeds in order to avoid hyperthermia during extended locomotion bouts. As a result, the highest travel speeds are achieved by animals of intermediate body mass, suggesting that the largest species are more limited in their movement capacities than previously anticipated. Consequently, we provide a mechanistic understanding of animal travel speed that can be generalised across species, even when the details of an individual species’ biology are unknown, to facilitate more realistic predictions of biodiversity dynamics in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Earth's surface temperature is rising, and precipitation patterns throughout the Earth are changing; the source of these shifts is likely anthropogenic in nature. Alterations in temperature and precipitation have obvious direct and indirect effects on both plants and animals. Notably, changes in temperature and precipitation alone can have both advantageous and detrimental consequences depending on the species. Typically, production of offspring is timed to coincide with optimal food availability; thus, individuals of many species display annual rhythms of reproductive function. Because it requires substantial time to establish or re‐establish reproductive function, individuals cannot depend on the arrival of seasonal food availability to begin breeding; thus, mechanisms have evolved in many plants and animals to monitor and respond to day length in order to anticipate seasonal changes in the environment. Over evolutionary time, there has been precise fine‐tuning of critical photoperiod and onset/offset of seasonal adaptations. Climate change has provoked changes in the availability of insects and plants which shifts the timing of optimal reproduction. However, adaptations to the stable photoperiod may be insufficiently plastic to allow a shift in the seasonal timing of bird and mammal breeding. Coupled with the effects of light pollution which prevents these species from determining day length, climate change presents extreme evolutionary pressure that can result in severe deleterious consequences for individual species reproduction and survival. This review describes the effects of climate change on plants and animals, defines photoperiod and the physiological events it regulates, and addresses the consequences of global climate change and a stable photoperiod.},

                  Climate warming creates energetic challenges for endothermic species by increasing metabolic and hydric costs of thermoregulation. Although endotherms can invoke an array of behavioural and physiological strategies for maintaining homeostasis, the relative effectiveness of those strategies in a climate that is becoming both warmer and drier is not well understood.
                
                
                  In accordance with the heat dissipation limit theory which suggests that allocation of energy to growth and reproduction by endotherms is constrained by the ability to dissipate heat, we expected that patterns of habitat use by large, heat‐sensitive mammals across multiple scales are critical for behavioural thermoregulation during periods of potential heat stress and that they must invest a large portion of time to maintain heat balance.
                
                
                  
                    To test our predictions, we evaluated mechanisms underpinning the effectiveness of bed sites for ameliorating daytime heat loads and potential heat stress across the landscape while accounting for other factors known to affect behaviour. We integrated detailed data on microclimate and animal attributes of moose
                    Alces alces
                    , into a biophysical model to quantify costs of thermoregulation at fine and coarse spatial scales.
                  
                
                
                  During summer, moose spent an average of 67.8\% of daylight hours bedded, and selected bed sites and home ranges that reduced risk of experiencing heat stress. For most of the day, shade could effectively mitigate the risk of experiencing heat stress up to 10°C, but at warmer temperatures (up to 20°C) wet soil was necessary to maintain homeostasis via conductive heat loss. Consistent selection across spatial scales for locations that reduced heat load underscores the importance of the thermal environment as a driver of behaviour in this heat‐sensitive mammal.
                
                
                  Moose in North America have long been characterized as riparian‐obligate species because of their dependence on woody plant species for food. Nevertheless, the importance of dissipating endogenous heat loads conductively through wet soil suggests riparian habitats also are critical thermal refuges for moose. Such refuges may be especially important in the face of a warming climate in which both high environmental temperatures and drier conditions will likely exacerbate limits to heat dissipation, especially for large, heat‐sensitive animals.},

The study of the hypothalamic neuromodulation of thermoregulation offers broad areas of opportunity with practical applications that are currently being strengthened by the availability of efficacious tools like infrared thermography ({IRT}). These areas could include the following: understanding the effect of climate change on behavior and productivity; analyzing the effects of exercise on animals involved in sporting activities; identifying the microvascular changes that occur in response to fear, pleasure, pain, and other situations that induce stress in animals; and examining thermoregulating behaviors. This research could contribute substantially to understanding the drastic modification of environments that have severe consequences for animals, such as loss of appetite, low productivity, neonatal hypothermia, and thermal shock, among others. Current knowledge of these physiological processes and complex anatomical structures, like the nervous systems and their close relation to mechanisms of thermoregulation, is still limited. The results of studies in fields like evolutionary neuroscience of thermoregulation show that we cannot yet objectively explain even processes that on the surface seem simple, including behavioral changes and the pathways and connections that trigger mechanisms like vasodilatation and panting. In addition, there is a need to clarify the connection between emotions and thermoregulation that increases the chances of survival of some organisms. An increasingly precise understanding of thermoregulation will allow us to design and apply practical methods in fields like animal science and clinical medicine without compromising levels of animal welfare. The results obtained should not only increase the chances of survival but also improve quality of life and animal production.},

                  North America has a diverse array of mammalian species. Model projections indicate significant variations in future climate conditions of North America, and the habitats of woodland mammals of this continent may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate.
                
                
                  We report on the potential spatial distributions of 13 wide‐ranging, relatively common species of North American woodland mammals under future climate scenarios.
                
                
                  We examined the potential influence of the mean and seasonal climate variables on the distribution of species. Presence‐only occurrence records of species, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5), and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species’ distribution models using a maximum entropy algorithm ({MaxEnt}).
                
                
                  
                    Our results suggested that overall, 11 of the 13 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space (regions where climate conditions will be similar to those of area currently occupied) at the continental scale, but American marten
                    Martes americana
                    and ‘woodland’ caribou
                    Rangifer tarandus
                    are likely to lose suitable climate range by 2070. Furthermore, climate space is likely to be expanding northwards under future climate scenarios for most of the mammals, and many jurisdictions in the border region between Canada and the {USA} are likely to lose iconic species, such as moose
                    Alces alces
                    . We identified regions as potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia, which are increasingly considered to be important for biodiversity conservation.
                  
                
                
                  The model results suggest significant implications for conservation planning for the 13 mammalian species under global climate change, especially at fine spatial scales. Numerous species that are presently common at their southern range edge will be functionally or completely extirpated in 50 years. The potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia could provide an effective support for adaptive strategies aimed at species conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Among agents of selection that shape phenotypic traits in animals, humans can cause more rapid changes than many natural factors. Studies have focused on human selection of morphological traits, but little is known about human selection of behavioural traits. By monitoring elk (
              Cervus elaphus
              ) with satellite telemetry, we tested whether individuals harvested by hunters adopted less favourable behaviours than elk that survived the hunting season. Among 45 2-year-old males, harvested elk showed bolder behaviour, including higher movement rate and increased use of open areas, compared with surviving elk that showed less conspicuous behaviour. Personality clearly drove this pattern, given that inter-individual differences in movement rate were present before the onset of the hunting season. Elk that were harvested further increased their movement rate when the probability of encountering hunters was high (close to roads, flatter terrain, during the weekend), while elk that survived decreased movements and showed avoidance of open areas. Among 77 females (2–19 y.o.), personality traits were less evident and likely confounded by learning because females decreased their movement rate with increasing age. As with males, hunters typically harvested females with bold behavioural traits. Among less-experienced elk (2–9 y.o.), females that moved faster were harvested, while elk that moved slower and avoided open areas survived. Interestingly, movement rate decreased as age increased in those females that survived, but not in those that were eventually harvested. The latter clearly showed lower plasticity and adaptability to the local environment. All females older than 9 y.o. moved more slowly, avoided open areas and survived. Selection on behavioural traits is an important but often-ignored consequence of human exploitation of wild animals. Human hunting could evoke exploitation-induced evolutionary change, which, in turn, might oppose adaptive responses to natural and sexual selection.},

While this never happens now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 °C, calling the habitability of some regions into question. With 11–12 °C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12 °C are possible from fossil fuel burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record.},

With this information in hand, biologists can predict organisms most at risk from environmental change. Biologists and managers can then target organisms and habitats most at risk. Unfortunately, the required data (e.g. optimal physiological temperatures) are rarely available. Here, we evaluate the reliability of potential proxies (e.g. critical temperatures) that are often available for some groups. Several proxies for ectotherms are promising, but analogous ones for endotherms are lacking. We also develop a simple graphical model of how behavioural thermoregulation, acclimation and adaptation may interact to influence vulnerability over time. After considering this model together with the proxies available for physiological sensitivity to climate change, we conclude that ectotherms sharing vulnerability traits seem concentrated in lowland tropical forests. Their vulnerability may be exacerbated by negative biotic interactions. Whether tropical forest (or other) species can adapt to warming environments is unclear, as genetic and selective data are scant. Nevertheless, the prospects for tropical forest ectotherms appear grim.},

Global weirding embraces all phenomena associated with climate change: increases in average temperatures, heat waves, cold spells, floods, droughts, hurricanes, blizzards, plant and animal die-offs, population explosions, new animal migration patterns, plus dramatic regional differences. Current data suggest that many alpine species will be lost to changes in habitat wrought by climate, particularly increases in average temperatures. For many wetlands, particularly in the central and southern interior of the province, the basic issue is simple—the incoming water is decreasing and the outgoing water (evaporation) is increasing. The authors illustrate three approaches to projecting trends in wetland habitat, elaborating on the “drying index” approach, in which they have most confidence. For wetland species, they say management will struggle with the concept of a real-world triage—allocating conservation efforts where they are most likely to succeed and have the most benefit. They conclude that several conservation approaches for wetland species will face the difficulty of allocating water between needs of these species and of humans.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A set of 182 populations of 76 mammal species in the United States and Canada, examined in natural conditions with minimized disturbances or management effects, shows that responses to climate change include negative responses, such as elevational range contractions, upward shifts and decreases in abundance, positive responses, such as range expansions, and no detectable responses. Responses vary among and within mammal species but many are correlated with species traits, particularly the responses linked to high extinction risks (= climate change risk: decreases in population sizes, range contractions, local extirpations). The traits showing the strongest links to differential responses to climate change are 1) body size—large mammals respond more often and most negatively to climate change, 2) activity times—few mammals with flexible active times respond to climate change, and 3) spatial distribution—high-latitude and high-elevation mammals responded more often to climate change. Using these traits and two approaches to trait weighting, I modeled the relative climate change risk for all 328 terrestrial, nonvolant mammal species in the United States and Canada across 10 levels of risk (low = 1–2, moderate = 3–4, moderate-high = 5–6, high = 7–8, very high = 9–10). The models predicted that 15\% of these mammalian species are in the high- and very high-risk categories, including species from most orders. Many mammal populations and species listed as of conservation concern due to other human impacts by national or international agencies are also predicted by my models to be in the higher categories of climate change risk. My intention for these models is to clarify for managers and researchers which, where, and how mammals are responding to climate change relatively independent of other anthropogenic stressors (e.g., large-scale habitat change, overhunting) and to provide a preliminary assessment of species most in need of careful monitoring for climate change impacts.},

            Animal migrations occur in many taxa and are considered an adaptive response to spatial or temporal variations in resources. Human activities can influence the cost-benefit trade-offs of animal migrations, but evaluating the determinants of migration trajectory and movement rate in declining populations facing relatively low levels of human disturbance can provide new and valuable insights on the behavior of wildlife in natural environments. Here, we used an adapted version of path selection functions and quantified the effects of habitat type, topography, and weather, on 313 spring migrations by migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in northern Québec, Canada, from 2011 to 2018. Our results showed that during spring migration, caribou selected tundra and avoided water bodies, forest, and higher elevation. Higher precipitation and deeper snow were linked to lower movement rates. Weather variables had a stronger effect on the migration trajectories and movement rates of females than males. Duration of caribou spring migration (mean of 48 days) and length (mean of 587 km) were similar in males and females, but females started (22 April) and ended (10 June) spring migrations ca. 6 days earlier than males. Caribou spring migration was influenced by habitat type, topography, and weather, but we also observed that caribou migrations were not spatially constrained. Better knowledge on where and when animals move between their winter and summer ranges can help inform management and land planning decisions. Our results could be used to model future migration trajectories and speed of caribou under different climate change scenarios.},

              Aim
              Range shift is a relatively well‐understood response to climate change, but our ability to predict shifts is limited. Two factors that may cause variation in range shifts across species are dispersal ability and varying rates of climate change through time and across space. Here, we assess patterns of range shifts during the late Quaternary and estimate how the velocity of climate change and the dispersal ability of a species affect the magnitude of species range shifts in response to climate change.
            
            
              Location
              North America.
            
            
              Methods
              We hindcast species distribution models for 122 North American mammals to five times over the past 17,000 years and forecast them to two future times given two emissions scenarios. Generalized additive models were constructed to quantify the importance of dispersal ability and the velocity of temperature and precipitation in determining the magnitude of range shift expected for individual species.
            
            
              Results
              
                Hindcasted and forecasted ranges demonstrate the variety of responses to climate change. In general, species shifted their ranges in a northerly direction (
                {NW}
                , N,
                {NE}
                ) regardless of the type of climate change (i.e., warming vs. cooling). The highest rates of range shifts during the past occurred during periods of relatively rapid climate change (Last Glacial Maximum/Bølling‐Allerød and Bølling‐Allerød/Younger Dryas transitions). Rates of range shifts for the future are projected to be significantly higher than any of the past intervals. The velocity of climate change is significantly associated with the magnitude of range shifts during climate transitions that occur over longer time‐scales, while maximum dispersal distance is important during periods of rapid climate change.
              
            
            
              Main Conclusions
              Our results suggest that both the dispersal ability and the velocity of climate change are significantly associated with species’ range shifts. However, the importance of these two factors is context‐dependent and depends on the interaction of the rate of climate change and the length of time over which the change occurs.},

                How organisms respond to and are influenced by temperature is one of the most fundamental aspects of ecology. Temperature affects animal physiology, behavior, survival, and reproduction. At broader spatial and temporal scales, temperature affects animal distributions, speciation, and evolution. Although entire textbooks have been devoted to how temperature is related to various aspects of basic animal ecology, applied ecologists have only recently begun to address thermal ecology in wildlife research. New investigations of thermal conditions relative to specific wildlife species have generally found tremendous variation within landscapes. Consequently, multiple species have been shown to respond in predictive ways to thermal variation. Variation in temperature can be due to both topoedaphic features inherent in the landscape as well as differences in vegetation structure and composition resulting from management actions. Although consideration of the thermal environment has received consideration for exothermic species, new evidence indicates that it has major implications to endotherms and may become even more critical under novel climate conditions. Rarely does management consider thermal cover explicitly or in a spatiotemporally dynamic way; in our view, this is a major short‐coming of current conservation planning and management actions. We argue that thermal environments should be foundational in the understanding of the habitat concept. Furthermore, restoration and management efforts should specifically consider thermal refuge and pinch points—the discrete time or event when thermal conditions experienced by an organism deviate to extreme values relative to average conditions and limit vital rates and space use of that organism. We suggest that future research on thermal environments work at scales relevant to organisms so that management can adequately address the full extent of a species’ habitat. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {The spatial scale at which an environmental variable is summarized can have considerable impacts on ecological inference of species distribution and abundance. While several analytical approaches have emerged to determine biologically relevant spatial scales – the spatial scale that most strongly influences the ecological patterns observed – identifying key ecological drivers of scale of effect is still underway. Additionally, several predicted ecological drivers of scale of effect can vary across space and time, but little research on spatiotemporal patterns has occurred. Here, I assessed spatial and temporal variation in scales of effect across 32 North American bird species using 18 years of empirical data from the North American breeding bird survey. Scale estimation was then coupled with trait‐based analyses and hypotheses testing of underlying processes of spatial and temporal variation in scales of effect. All 32 species tested exhibited varied scales of effect across years (average annual scales of effect ranging from 0.2 to 4.97 km) and Bird Conservation Regions ({BCR}), with spatial variability being the most pronounced. Trait‐based analyses revealed a contrary relationship between hand‐wing index, body size, and scale of effect, though the strength of this relationship was contingent on migratory status. Temporal variation in scales of effect was best explained by changes in human development over time, indicating that avian space use can be explained by an increasing human footprint. Additionally, relative population size, consistent with theoretical predictions stemming from density‐dependent population dynamics, explained notable variation in spatial and temporal scales of effect. These findings contribute to the growing landscape ecology literature by providing empirical evidence for hypothesized drivers of scales of effect. By delineating species‐specific scales of effect and elucidating their ecological drivers, this study enhances our understanding of spatial and temporal scales in ecological processes, aiding conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.},

(J Am Stat Assoc 112(519):1199–1210, 2017) developed methods for fitting penalized regression spline based generalized additive models, with of the order of \$\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$\$ coefficients, to up to \$\$10{\textasciicircum}8\$\$ data. The methods offered two to three orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost relative to the most efficient previous methods. Part of the gain resulted from the development of a set of methods for efficiently computing model matrix products when model covariates each take only a discrete set of values substantially smaller than the sample size [generalizing an idea first appearing in Lang et al. (Stat Comput 24(2):223–238, 2014)]. Covariates can always be rounded to achieve such discretization, and it should be noted that the covariate discretization is marginal. That is we do not rely on discretizing covariates jointly, which would typically require the use of very coarse discretization. The most expensive computation in model estimation is the formation of the matrix cross product \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{T\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{WX}\}\}\$\$ where \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}\$\$ is a model matrix and \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{W\}\}\$\$ a diagonal or tri-diagonal matrix. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple, novel and substantially more efficient approach to the computation of this cross product. The new method offers, for example, a 30 fold reduction in cross product computation time for the Black Smoke model dataset motivating Wood et al. (2017). Given this reduction in computational cost, the subsequent Cholesky decomposition of \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{T\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{WX}\}\}\$\$ and follow on computation of \$\$({\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{T\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{WX}\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$\$ become a more significant part of the computational burden, and we also discuss the choice of methods for improving their speed.},

	abstract = {Habitat selection models frequently use data collected from a small geographic area over a short window of time to extrapolate patterns of relative abundance into unobserved areas or periods of time. However, such models often poorly predict the distribution of animal space‐use intensity beyond the place and time of data collection, presumably because space‐use behaviors vary between individuals and environmental contexts. Similarly, ecological inference based on habitat selection models could be muddied or biased due to unaccounted individual and context dependencies. Here, we present a modeling workflow designed to allow transparent variance‐decomposition of habitat‐selection patterns, and consequently improved inferential and predictive capacities. Using global positioning system ({GPS}) data collected from 238 individual pronghorn,
              Antilocapra americana
              , across three years in Utah, {USA}, we combine individual‐year‐season‐specific exponential habitat‐selection models with weighted mixed‐effects regressions to both draw inference about the drivers of habitat selection and predict space‐use in areas/times where/when pronghorn were not monitored. We found a tremendous amount of variation in both the magnitude and direction of habitat selection behavior across seasons, but also across individuals, geographic regions, and years. We were able to attribute portions of this variation to season, movement strategy, sex, and regional variability in resources, conditions, and risks. We were also able to partition residual variation into inter‐ and intra‐individual components. We then used the results to predict population‐level, spatially and temporally dynamic, habitat‐selection coefficients across Utah, resulting in a temporally dynamic map of pronghorn distribution at a 30 × 30 m resolution but an extent of 220 000 km
              2
              . We believe our transferable workflow can provide managers and researchers alike a way to turn limitations of traditional habitat selection models – variability in habitat selection – into a tool to understand and predict species‐habitat associations across space and time.},

Such studies frequently involve either individually indexed locations gathered across limited spatial extents and analyzed using resource selection functions ({RSFs}) or spatially extensive locational data without individual resolution typically analyzed using species distribution models. Both analytical methodologies have certain desirable features, but analyses that combine individual‐ and population‐level inference with flexible non‐linear functions may provide improved predictions while accounting for individual variation. Here, we describe how {RSFs} can be fit using hierarchical generalized additive models ({HGAMs}) using widely available software, providing a means to explore individual variation in habitat associations and to generate species distribution maps. We used {GPS} tracking data from golden eagles
              Aquila chrysaetos
              from across eastern North America with four environmental predictors to generate monthly distribution models. We considered three model structures that assumed different amounts of individual variation in the functional relationship between predictors and habitat use and used
              k
              ‐fold cross‐validation to compare model performance. Models accounting for individual variability in shape and smoothness of functional responses performed best. Eagles exhibited the least amount of individual variation in response to land cover variables during winter months, with most individuals more closely adhering to the population‐level trend. During the summer months, eagles exhibited more substantial individual variation in shape and smoothness of the functional relationships, suggesting some need to account for individual variation in eagle habitat use for both inferential and predictive purposes, during this time of year. Because they allow users to blend flexible functions with random effects structures and are well‐supported by a variety of software platforms, we believe that {HGAMs} provide a useful addition to the suite of analyses used for modeling habitat associations or predicting species distributions.},

            The amount of space organisms use is thought to be tightly linked to the availability of resources within their habitats, such that organisms living in productive habitats generally require less space than those in resource-poor habitats. This hypothesis has widespread em-pirical support, but existing studies have focused primarily on responses to the mean amount of resources, while responses to the variance around the mean are still largely unknown. This is not a trivial oversight. Organisms adjust to variable environmental conditions, so failing to consider the effects of resource (un)predictability can result in a limited understanding of an organism’s range size, which challenges ecological theory and applied conservation alike. In this study, we leverage the available literature to provide a unifying framework and hypotheses for the effect of mean and variance in resources on range sizes. Next, we use simulated movement data to demonstrate how the combined effects of mean and variance in resource abundance interact to shape predictable patterns in range size. Finally, we use real-world tracking data on a lowland tapir (
            Tapirus terrestris
            ) from the Brazilian Cerrado to show how this framework can be applied to better understand the movement ecology of free-ranging animals.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            The energetic cost of locomotion can be a substantial proportion of an animal's daily energy budget and thus key to its ecology. Studies on myriad species have added to our knowledge about the general cost of animal movement, including the effects of variations in the environment such as terrain angle. However, further such studies might provide diminishing returns on the development of a deeper understanding of how animals trade-off the cost of movement with other energy costs, and other ecological currencies such as time. Here, I propose the ‘individual energy landscape’ as an approach to conceptualising the choices facing the optimising animal. In this Commentary, first I outline previous broad findings about animal walking and running locomotion, focusing in particular on the use of net cost of transport as a metric of comparison between species, and then considering the effects of environmental perturbations and other extrinsic factors on movement costs. I then introduce and explore the idea that these factors combine with the behaviour of the animal in seeking short-term optimality to create that animal's individual energy landscape – the result of the geographical landscape and environmental factors combined with the animal's selected trade-offs. Considering an animal's locomotion energy expenditure within this context enables hard-won empirical data on transport costs to be applied to questions about how an animal can and does move through its environment to maximise its fitness, and the relative importance, or otherwise, of locomotion energy economy.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            Motion is a crucial part of the natural world, yet our understanding of how animals avoid predation whilst moving remains rather limited. Although several theories have been proposed for how antipredator defence may be facilitated during motion, there is often a lack of supporting empirical evidence, or conflicting findings. Furthermore, many studies have shown that motion often ‘breaks’ camouflage, as sudden movement can be detected even before an individual is recognised. Whilst some static camouflage strategies may conceal moving animals to a certain extent, more emphasis should be given to other modes of camouflage and related defences in the context of motion (e.g. flicker fusion camouflage, active motion camouflage, motion dazzle, and protean motion). Furthermore, when motion is involved, defence strategies are not necessarily limited to concealment. An animal can also rely on motion to mislead predators with regards to its trajectory, location, size, colour pattern, or even identity. In this review, we discuss the various underlying antipredator strategies and the mechanisms through which they may be linked to motion, conceptualising existing empirical and theoretical studies from two perspectives – concealing and misleading effects. We also highlight gaps in our understanding of these antipredator strategies, and suggest possible methodologies for experimental designs/test subjects (i.e. prey and/or predators) and future research directions.},

              The collective dynamics of self-organised systems emerge from the decision rules agents use to respond to each other and to external forces. This is evident in groups of animals under attack from predators, where understanding collective escape patterns requires evaluating the risks and rewards associated with particular social rules, prey escape behaviour, and predator attack strategies. Here, we find that the emergence of the ‘fountain effect’, a common collective pattern observed when animal groups evade predators, is the outcome of rules designed to maximise individual survival chances given predator hunting decisions. Using drone-based empirical observations of schooling sardine prey (
              Sardinops sagax caerulea
              ) attacked by striped marlin (
              Kajikia audax
              ), we first find the majority of attacks produce fountain effects, with the dynamics of these escapes dependent on the predator’s attack direction. Then, using a spatially-explicit agent-based model of predator-prey dynamics, we show that fountain manoeuvres can emerge from combining an optimal individual prey escape angle with social interactions. The escape rule appears to prioritise maximising the distance to the predator and creates conflict in the effectiveness of predators’ attacks and the prey’s avoidance, explaining the empirically observed predators’ attack strategies and the fountain evasions produced by prey. Overall, we identify the proximate and ultimate explanations for fountain effects and more generally highlight that the collective patterns of self-organised predatory-prey systems can be understood by considering both social escape rules and attack strategies.},

            Movement is essential in the ecology of most animals, and it typically consumes a large proportion of individual energy budgets. Environmental conditions modulate the energetic cost of movement (cost of transport, {COT}), and there are pronounced differences in {COT} between individuals within species and across species. Differences in morphology affect {COT}, but the physiological mechanisms underlying variation in {COT} remain unresolved. Candidates include mitochondrial efficiency and the efficiency of muscle contraction–relaxation dynamics. Animals can offset increased {COT} behaviourally by adjusting movement rate and habitat selection. Here, we review the theory underlying {COT} and the impact of environmental changes on {COT}. Increasing temperatures, in particular, increase {COT} and its variability between individuals. Thermal acclimation and exercise can affect {COT}, but this is not consistent across taxa. Anthropogenic pollutants can increase {COT}, although few chemical pollutants have been investigated. Ecologically, {COT} may modify the allocation of energy to different fitness-related functions, and thereby influence fitness of individuals, and the dynamics of animal groups and communities. Future research should consider the effects of multiple stressors on {COT}, including a broader range of pollutants, the underlying mechanisms of {COT} and experimental quantifications of potential {COT}-induced allocation trade-offs.},

            Predator–prey interactions are critical to the biology of a diversity of animals. Although prey capture is determined by the direction, velocity, and timing of motion by both animals, it is generally unclear what strategies are employed by predators and prey to guide locomotion. Here we review our research on fishes that tests the pursuit strategy of predators and the evasion strategy of prey through kinematic measurements and agent-based models. This work demonstrates that fish predators track prey with variations on a deviated-pursuit strategy that is guided by visual cues. Fish prey employ a mixed strategy that varies with factors such as the direction of a predator’s approach. Our models consider the stochastic nature of interactions by incorporating measured probability distributions to accurately predict measurements of survivorship. A sensitivity analysis of these models shows the importance of the response distance of prey to their survival. Collectively, this work demonstrates how strategy affects the outcome of predator–prey interactions and articulates the roles of sensing, control, and propulsion. The research program that we have developed has the potential to offer a framework for the study of strategy in the predator–prey interactions of a variety of animals.},

              Temperature imposes significant constraints on ectothermic animals, and these organisms have evolved numerous adaptations to respond to these constraints. While the impacts of temperature on the physiology of ectotherms have been extensively studied, there are currently no frameworks available that outline the multiple and often simultaneous pathways by which temperature can affect behaviour. Drawing from the literature on insects, we propose a unified framework that should apply to all ectothermic animals, generalizing temperature's behavioural effects into: (1) kinetic effects, resulting from temperature's bottom‐up constraining influence on metabolism and neurophysiology over a range of timescales (from short to long term), and (2) integrated effects, where the top‐down integration of thermal information intentionally initiates or modifies a behaviour (behavioural thermoregulation, thermal orientation, thermosensory behavioural adjustments). We discuss the difficulty in distinguishing adaptive behavioural changes from constraints when observing animals' behavioural responses to temperature. We then propose two complementary approaches to distinguish adaptations from constraints, and categorize behaviours according to our framework: (
              i
              ) ‘kinetic null modelling’ of temperature's effects on behaviour; and (
              ii
              ) behavioural ecology experiments using temperature‐insensitive mutants. Our framework should help to guide future research on the complex relationship between temperature and behaviour in ectothermic animals.},

Unfortunately, however, the equally important and enormous water (withdrawal and consumption) footprint of {AI} models has remained under the radar. For example, training {GPT}-3 in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More critically, the global {AI} demand may be accountable for 4.2 -- 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 -- 6 Denmark or half of the United Kingdom. This is very concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, {AI} models can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water footprint of {AI} models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of {AI} models' runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable {AI}.},

              Migratory ungulates are thought to be declining globally because their dependence on large landscapes renders them highly vulnerable to environmental change. Yet recent studies reveal that many ungulate species can adjust their migration propensity in response to changing environmental conditions to potentially improve population persistence. In addition to the question of
              whether
              to migrate, decisions of
              where
              and
              when
              to migrate appear equally fundamental to individual migration tactics, but these three dimensions of plasticity have rarely been explored together. Here, we expand the concept of migratory plasticity beyond individual switches in migration propensity to also include spatial and temporal adjustments to migration patterns. We develop a novel typological framework that delineates every potential change type within the three dimensions, then use this framework to guide a literature review. We discuss broad patterns in migratory plasticity, potential drivers of migration change, and research gaps in the current understanding of this trait. Our result reveals 127 migration change events in direct response to natural and human‐induced environmental changes across 27 ungulate species. Species that appeared in multiple studies showed multiple types of change, with some exhibiting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity. This result highlights that multidimensional migratory plasticity is pervasive in ungulates, even as the manifestation of plasticity varies case by case. However, studies thus far have rarely been able to determine the fitness outcomes of different types of migration change, likely due to the scarcity of long‐term individual‐based demographic monitoring as well as measurements encompassing a full behavioral continuum and environmental gradient for any given species. Recognizing and documenting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity marks the first step for the field of migration ecology to employ quantitative methods, such as reaction norms, to predict migration change along environmental gradients. Closer monitoring for changes in migratory propensity, routes, and timing may improve the efficacy of conservation strategies and management actions in a rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {As habitat loss and fragmentation increase across ungulate ranges, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on new urgency. Here we present a general framework using the Brownian bridge movement model ({BBMM}) that: (1) provides a probabilistic estimate of the migration routes of a sampled population, (2) distinguishes between route segments that function as stopover sites vs. those used primarily as movement corridors, and (3) prioritizes routes for conservation based upon the proportion of the sampled population that uses them. We applied this approach to a migratory mule deer (
              Odocoileus hemionus
              ) population in a pristine area of southwest Wyoming, {USA}, where 2000 gas wells and 1609 km of pipelines and roads have been proposed for development. Our analysis clearly delineated where migration routes occurred relative to proposed development and provided guidance for on‐the‐ground conservation efforts. Mule deer migration routes were characterized by a series of stopover sites where deer spent most of their time, connected by movement corridors through which deer moved quickly. Our findings suggest management strategies that differentiate between stopover sites and movement corridors may be warranted. Because some migration routes were used by more mule deer than others, proportional level of use may provide a reasonable metric by which routes can be prioritized for conservation. The methods we outline should be applicable to a wide range of species that inhabit regions where migration routes are threatened or poorly understood.},

                    The migratory movements of wild animals can promote abundance and support ecosystem functioning. For large herbivores, mounting evidence suggests that migratory behaviour is an individually variable trait, where individuals can easily switch between migrant and resident tactics. The degree of migratory plasticity, including
                    whether
                    and
                    where
                    to migrate, has important implications for the ecology and conservation of large herbivores in a changing world.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Mule deer (
                    Odocoileus hemionus
                    ) are an iconic species of western North America, but are notably absent from the body of literature that suggests large herbivore migrations are highly plastic. We evaluated plasticity of migration in female mule deer using longitudinal
                    {GPS}
                    data collected from 312 individuals across nine populations in the western United States, including 882 animal‐years (801 migrants and 81 residents).
                  
                
                
                  
                    We followed both resident and migratory mule deer through time to determine whether individual animals switched migratory behaviours (i.e.,
                    whether
                    to migrate) from migratory to residency or vice versa. Additionally, we examined the fidelity of individuals to their migration routes (i.e.,
                    where
                    to migrate) to determine whether they used the same routes year after year. We also evaluated whether age and reproductive status affected propensity to migrate or fidelity to migratory routes.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Our results indicate that mule deer, unlike other large herbivores, have little or no plasticity in terms of
                    whether
                    or
                    where
                    they migrate. Resident deer remained residents, and migrant deer remained migrants, regardless of age, reproductive status or number of years monitored. Further, migratory individuals showed strong fidelity ({\textgreater}80\%) to their migration routes year after year.
                  
                
                
                  Our study clearly shows that migration plasticity is not ubiquitous among large herbivores. Because of their rigid migratory behaviour, mule deer may not adapt to changing environmental conditions as readily as large herbivores with more plastic migratory behaviour (e.g., elk). The fixed migratory behaviours of mule deer make clear that conservation efforts aimed at traditional seasonal ranges and migration routes are warranted for sustaining this iconic species that continues to decline across its range.},

            The recent intensification of floods and droughts in the Fraser River Basin ({FRB}) of British Columbia has had profound cultural, ecological, and economic impacts that are expected to be exacerbated further by anthropogenic climate change. In part due to short instrumental runoff records, the long-term stationarity of hydroclimatic extremes in this major North American watershed remains poorly understood, highlighting the need to use high-resolution paleoenvironmental proxies to inform on past streamflow. Here we use a network of tree-ring proxy records to develop 11 subbasin-scale, complementary flood- and drought-season reconstructions, the first of their kind. The reconstructions explicitly target management-relevant flood and drought seasons within each basin, and are examined in tandem to provide an expanded assessment of extreme events across the {FRB} with immediate implications for water management. We find that past high flood-season flows have been of greater magnitude and occurred in more consecutive years than during the observational record alone. Early 20th century low flows in the drought season were especially severe in both duration and magnitude in some subbasins relative to recent dry periods. Our Fraser subbasin-scale reconstructions provide long-term benchmarks for the natural flood and drought variability prior to anthropogenic forcing. These reconstructions demonstrate that the instrumental streamflow records upon which current management is based likely underestimate the full natural magnitude, duration, and frequency of extreme seasonal flows in the {FRB}, as well as the potential severity of future anthropogenically forced events.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            The diversity in organismal responses to environmental changes (i.e., response diversity) plays a crucial role in shaping community and ecosystem stability. However, existing measures of response diversity only consider a single environmental variable, whereas natural communities are commonly exposed to changes in multiple environmental variables simultaneously. Thus far, no approach exists to integrate multifarious environmental change and the measurement of response diversity. Here, we show how to consider and quantify response diversity in the context of multifarious environmental change, and in doing so introduce a distinction between response diversity to a defined or anticipated environmental change, and the response capacity to any possible set of (defined or undefined) future environmental changes. First, we describe and illustrate the concepts with empirical data. We reveal the role of the trajectory of environmental change in shaping response diversity when multiple environmental variables fluctuate over time. We show that, when the trajectory of the environmental change is undefined (i.e., there is no information or a priori expectation about how an environmental condition will change in future), we can quantify the response capacity of a community to any possible environmental change scenario. That is, we can estimate the capacity of a system to respond under a range of realistic or extreme environmental changes, with utility for predicting future responses to even multifarious environmental change. Finally, we investigate determinants of response diversity within a multifarious environmental change context. We identify factors such as the diversity of species responses to each environmental variable, the relative influence of different environmental variables and temporal means of environmental variable values as important determinants of response diversity. In doing so, we take an important step towards measuring and understanding the insurance capacity of ecological communities exposed to multifarious environmental change.

            Sommario
            La diversità con cui gli organismi rispondono ai cambiamenti ambientali (ovvero la diversità di risposta) svolge un ruolo cruciale nel determinare la stabilità delle comunità ecologiche e degli ecosistemi. Tuttavia i metodi esistenti per quantificare la diversità di risposta considerano solo una singola variabile ambientale, mentre le comunità naturali sono normalmente esposte a fluttuazioni di più variabili ambientali contemporaneamente. Al momento non esiste un approccio per quantificare la diversità di risposta quando più variabili ambientali fluttuano contemporaneamente. In questo articolo spieghiamo come quantificare la diversità di risposta considerando diverse variabili ambientali. In questo modo introduciamo una distinzione tra la diversità di risposta a un cambiamento ambientale definito o previsto e la capacità di risposta a qualsiasi possibile insieme di cambiamenti ambientali futuri (definiti o non definiti). Per prima cosa descriviamo e illustriamo i concetti con dati empirici. Sottolineiamo il ruolo della traiettoria del cambiamento ambientale nel plasmare la diversità di risposta quando più variabili ambientali fluttuano nel tempo. Mostriamo che, quando la traiettoria del cambiamento ambientale è indefinita (cioè, non ci sono informazioni o previsioni a priori su come le variabili ambientali cambieranno in futuro), possiamo quantificare la capacità di risposta di una comunità a qualsiasi possibile scenario di cambiamento ambientale. In altre parole, possiamo stimare la capacità di un sistema di rispondere a una serie di cambiamenti ambientali realistici o estremi, con la finalità di prevedere le risposte future a cambiamenti ambientali, anche stocastici. Infine, analizziamo i fattori che determinano la diversità di risposta quando più variabili ambientali cambiano nel tempo. Identifichiamo fattori come la diversità delle risposte delle specie a ciascuna variabili ambientali, l'importanza relativa di diverse variabili ambientali nel determinare le risposte delle specie, e la media delle variabili ambientali come importanti fattori che determinano la diversità delle risposte. Con questo studio compiamo un passo importante verso la quantificazione e la comprensione della capacità delle comunità ecologiche di mantenere la loro stabilità anche quando esposte a molteplici cambiamenti ambientali.},

              Aim
              For many applications in biodiversity and ecology, existing remote sensing‐derived land‐cover products have limitations due to among‐product inconsistency and their typically non‐continuous nature. Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1‐km resolution global product that provides scale‐integrated and accuracy‐weighted consensus land‐cover information on an approximately continuous scale.
            
            
              Location
              Global.
            
            
              Methods
              Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy‐based integration approach, we integrated four global land‐cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30‐m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists.
            
            
              Results
              
                Our product offers accuracy‐weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land‐cover classes within every nominal 1‐km pixel across the globe (except for
                A
                ntarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land‐cover information contained in the fine‐grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine‐grain land‐cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions.
              
            
            
              Main conclusions
              Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land‐cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land‐cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.},

            During the past century, the fundamental niche, the complete set of environments that allow an individual, population, or species to persist, has shaped ecological thinking. It is a crucial concept connecting population dynamics, spatial ecology, and evolutionary theory, and a prerequisite for predictive ecological models at a time of rapid environmental change. Yet, its properties have eluded quantification, particularly for mobile, cognitively complex organisms. These difficulties are mainly a result of the separation between niche theory and field data, and the dichotomy between environmental and geographical spaces. Here, I combine recent mathematical and statistical results linking habitats to population growth, to achieve a quantitative and intuitive understanding of the fundamental niches of animals. I trace the development of niche ideas from the early steps of ecology to their use in modern statistical and conservation practice. I examine how animal mobility and behavior may blur the division between geographical and environmental space. I discuss how the central models of population and spatial ecology lead to a concise mathematical equation for the fundamental niche of animals and demonstrate how fitness parameters can be understood and directly estimated by fitting this model simultaneously to data on population growth and spatial distributions. I first illustrate these concepts theoretically for territorial species. I then fit the fundamental niche model to a data set of house sparrow colonies to quantify how a species of selective animals can increase their fitness in heterogeneous environments. This work confirms ideas that had been anticipated in the historical niche literature. Specifically, within traditionally defined environmental spaces, habitat heterogeneity and behavioral plasticity make the fundamental niche more complex and malleable than was historically envisaged. However, once examined in higher‐dimensional environmental spaces, accounting for spatial heterogeneity, the niche is more predictable than recently suspected. This re‐evaluation quantifies how organisms might buffer themselves from change by bending the boundaries of viable environmental space and offers a framework for designing optimal habitat interventions to protect biodiversity or obstruct invasive species. It therefore promotes the fundamental niche as a key concept for understanding animal responses to changing environments and a central tool for environmental management.},

	abstract = {Modern ecological research often involves the comparison of the usage of habitat types or food items to the availability of those resources to the animal. Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in this paper.},

                    Kernel density estimators are widely applied to area‐related problems in ecology, from estimating the home range of an individual to estimating the geographic range of a species. Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals.
                  
                  
                    We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data.
                  
                  
                    The area‐corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives.
                  
                  
                    
                      This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home‐range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the
